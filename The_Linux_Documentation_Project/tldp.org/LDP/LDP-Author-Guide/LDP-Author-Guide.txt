   Added notes about prefered submission formats, corrected links,
   packaged templates.Typo fixed in sample DocBook markup. Added new
   web-based authoring tool and information on LaTeX to DocBook
   conversions.Typos fixed in xmlto notes and book template. Copied
   information about DocBook-capable word processing tools into the
   "Converting Documents to DocBook XML" Appendix; added new XML
   editors; and information about tools to convert other formats to
   DocBook XML.Updated information regarding CVS accounts and connecting
   to the CVS server.Added editor credit requirements to the Using
   DocBook section. Updated the submission procedure. New documents can
   now only be added by one of the Review Coordinators after the
   successful completion of each of the required reviews.Removed the
   section Contributing to The LDP (replaced by Summary of The LDP
   Process).Added references for LyX to DocBook conversions in the
   bibliography.Updated the license requirements and added them to the

Chapter 1. About this Guide

1.1. About this Guide

   This document was started on Aug 26, 1999 by Mark F. Komarinski after
   two day's worth of frustration getting tools to work. If even one LDP
   author is helped by this, then I did my job.

   Version 4 of this document was released in early 2004 by Emma Jane
   Hogbin. A complete overhaul of the document was done to separate the
   authoring HOWTOs from the technical HOWTOs. The review took
   approximately eight months.

   The newest version of this document can be found at the LDP homepage
   [http://www.tldp.org/] http://www.tldp.org. The original DocBook,
   HTML, and other formats can be found there.

   There are many ways to contribute to the Linux movement that do not
   require the ability to produce software. One such way is to write
   documentation. The availability of easy-to-understand, technically
   accurate documentation can make a world of difference to someone who
   is struggling with Linux software. This Guide is designed to help you
   research and write a HOWTO which can be submitted to the LDP. The
   appendices also include sample templates, markup tips and information
   on how to transform your document from DocBook to another format
   (such as HTML) for easier proofreading.
     ________________________________________________________________

1.2. About The LDP

   The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) was started to provide new
   users a way of quickly getting information about a particular
   subject. It not only contains a series of books on administration,
   networking, and programming, but also has a large number of smaller
   works on individual subjects, written by those who have used it. If
   you want to find out about printing, you get the Printing HOWTO. If
   you want to do find out if your Ethernet card works with Linux, grab
   the Ethernet HOWTO, and so on.

   The LDP provides documents to the world in a variety of convenient
   formats and also accepts submissions in a number of formats. The
   current standard for storing the source documentation is a format
   known as DocBook, see Section 5.2.


   The Linux Documentation Project (LDP) is working on developing free,
   high-quality documentation for the GNU/Linux operating system. The
   overall goal of the LDP is to collaborate in all of the issues of
   Linux documentation. This includes the creation of "HOWTOs" and
   "Guides". We hope to establish a system of documentation for Linux
   that will be easy to use and search. This includes the integration of
   the manual pages, info docs, HOWTOs, and other documents.

   --LDP Manifesto located at [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html]
   http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html

   The human readable version goes more like this: The LDP consists of a
   large group of volunteers who are working on documentation about
   Linux and the programs which run on the Linux kernel. These documents
   exist primarily as shorter HOWTOs and longer Guides. Both are
   available from [http://www.tldp.org/] http://www.tldp.org/. This
   Guide focuses primarily on how to write your own HOWTOs for
   submission to the LDP.

Chapter 2. Authoring TLDP Documents: An Introduction

2.1. Summary of The LDP Process

   The following section outlines the process of creating and/or
   maintaining a document for the Linux Documentation Project. This
   section includes all steps--some of which may not be relevant to your
   specific document.

    1. Join the discuss mailing list. Authors who are interested in
       taking over the maintenance of someone else's document should
       also join this list. This is to make sure the LDP knows who is
       working on what documentation.
       If you have not yet written your documentation, please review our
       documents ([http://tldp.org/HOWTO/HOWTO-INDEX/howtos.html]
       current, [http://tldp.org/authors/unmaint.html] unmaintained and
       [] in progress) and submit a proposal to the list. Your proposal
       should include reasons why your document will be different than
       those already in the collection; or identify a subject that is
       currently missing from our documentation. For more information
       about writing proposals, please read Chapter 3.
       For more information about the mailing lists, please read Section
       2.2 or visit [http://lists.tldp.org] lists.tldp.org to subscribe.
       If your document has already been written, please submit a copy
       to the discuss list (or include the URL of where it can be
       found).
    2. Write your document. If your document has not yet been written,
       please be sure to email the discuss list before you start
       writing. You may choose whatever format you feel most comfortable
       in to write your document. If it is not one of the formats
       accepted by the LDP a volunteer will convert it for you. For more
       information on writing technical documentation, please read
       Chapter 4.
    3. If you are adding your own markup, you may also want to join the
       docbook mailing list. For more information about the LDP DocBook
       list please read Section 2.2. If you would like to start with a
       template, you may find the templates in Appendix A useful. There
       is also a general introduction to markup in Chapter 5 and a
       section full of examples at Appendix D.
    4. Submit your document for technical, language and metadata
       reviews. Do this by emailing your document to
       <submit@en.tldp.org>. In the subject line be sure give the title
       of the document. In the body of the email say that you are ready
       for the review process. Outline any additional reviews your
       document may have already received. You should be assigned a
       reviewer within the week. The reviews may take an additional week
       each. For more information about this process, please read
       Chapter 6.
       If your document is not already in DocBook or LinuxDoc format, a
       reviewer will convert it for you.
    5. Once your document has been through each of the reviews a Review
       Coordinator will add it to the CVS, update the version number to
       1.0 and have the document published on the public Web site. For
       more information about your final submission to the LDP, please
       read Section 6.5.

   Tip If you don't submit your document in DocBook format


   The volunteer adding markup to your document may choose any accepted
   markup language. The Author Guide, however, will refer only to
   DocBook. If you are submitting plain text or some other format,
   please let the LDP know if you prefer to maintain your document in
   either LinuxDoc or DocBook, which are the accepted formats for
   end-results.
     ________________________________________________________________

2.2. Mailing Lists

   You can subscribe to the following mailing lists:

     * First is <discuss@en.tldp.org>, which is the main discussion
       group of the LDP.
     * Another is the <docbook@en.tldp.org> list, which is for questions
       about DocBook use including markup and transformations. If you
       run into trouble with a particular markup tag, you can send your
       question here for answers.

   You can subscribe to either list by sending a request message to
   either <discuss-subscribe@en.tldp.org> or
   <docbook-subscribe@en.tldp.org>. The subject of your message should
   read "subscribe" (no quotes). To remove yourself from the list, send
   an E-mail with the subject of "unsubscribe" to
   <discuss-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org> or
   <docbook-unsubscribe@en.tldp.org>.

   If you are interested in DocBook beyond the simple markup of your LDP
   document, you may want to consider joining one of the
   [http://www.oasis-open.org/] OASIS DocBook mailing lists. Please see
   [http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html]
   http://docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html for more information.
     ________________________________________________________________

Chapter 3. Writing Your Proposal

3.1. Choosing a Subject

   It is likely that if you are reading the Author Guide, you already
   have a subject in mind. The idea may have come from your own
   frustrations in trying to get something to work; or maybe you are
   already writing or have written documentation for other purposes and
   you want to submit it to the LDP. For example, if you posted a
   question to a mailing list and it took many posts to resolve the
   problem -- that might be an incentive to write documentation.

   Regardless of how you picked your subject, it is important that the
   LDP community understand why your documentation should be included in
   its collection. If someone has requested documentation, or you worked
   with a mailing list to resolve a problem you should include the
   details in your proposal to the LDP discuss mailing list. It may help
   others to understand the need for your specific document.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.2. Scope of Your Document

   Now that you've got a subject, you will need to decide the scope of
   the document. The scope or subject area should be:

    1. Clearly defined. Define the boundaries of your subject area
       before you begin. Do not repeat information that is in another
       HOWTO and do not leave gaps of information between your HOWTO and
       someone else's HOWTO.
    2. Not too broad, and not too narrow. If you try to cover too much
       information you may sacrifice depth. It is better to cover a
       small subject area in detail than to cover a large subject area
       poorly. Linux tools are known for doing exactly one thing and
       doing that one thing well. Similarly, your HOWTO should cover one
       subject and cover it well.
       If the scope of your proposed document is very narrow, it might
       be better to include your information as part of another HOWTO.
       This makes it easier for readers to find the HOWTO they need.
       Search the LDP repository for topics which relate to your
       document. If you find a document which is a good match, email the
       author and ask them if they would like to include your
       contribution.
    3. Undocumented. Before documenting a particular subject, always do
       a web search (and specifically a search within the LDP documents)
       to see if your topic is already covered in another document. If
       it is, refer to the other document instead of duplicating the
       information within your own document. You may wish to include a
       brief summary of information that can be found in other
       documents.
       If the HOWTO already in place is insufficient or needs updating,
       contact the author and offer to help. See also Section 3.3 for
       taking over old or unmaintained documents.
       Most authors appreciate any help offered. Additionally, sending
       comments and remarks to the author is usually regarded both as a
       reassurance and a reward: to the author, feedback is the ultimate
       proof that writing the documentation was not a pointless effort.
    4. Pre-approved by the LDP. Before you proceed with your HOWTO, post
       to the discuss list and get some feedback from other LDP
       volunteers. Checking with the list before you begin can save you
       headaches later.

   Note Stay in touch!


   Joining the discuss list and following it regularly, even if you
   never post, is a good way to stay current on the activities, needs
   and policies of the LDP.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.2.1. Documentation Templates

   After you've decided the scope of your document you should start to
   consider the type of document that you will write. There are a number
   of different LDP documentation templates: Guides, HOWTOs, man pages
   and FAQs. Rahul Sundaram describes their scope in the Linux
   Documentation Project (LDP) FAQ. Here is a brief overview of what
   they are with pointers on how you can get started writing your own:

     * Guides. A guide covers a broad subject and is quite long. The
       Author Guide (this document) is a guide. Other guides include:
       Introduction to Linux: A hands on guide, The Linux Kernel Module
       Programming Guide, etc. A full list of guides is available from:
       Linux Project Documentation Guides. Guides use the "book"
       templates located in Appendix A.
     * HOWTOs. A HOWTO is typically a set of instructions that outlines,
       step-by-step, how a specific task is accomplished. Examples of
       HOWTOs are: [http://tldp.org/HOWTO/CDROM-HOWTO/index.html]
       CDROM-HOWTO [http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Module-HOWTO/index.html]
       Module-HOWTO. A full list of HOWTOs is available from: Single
       List of HOWTOs (warning: it's a BIG page). HOWTOs typically use
       the "article" template and are output to multiple HTML pages by
       default. Templates are available in Appendix A.
     * man pages. man (Manual) pages are the standard form of help
       available for many linux applications and utilities. They can be
       viewed by typing man applicationname at a prompt. A full list of
       man pages is available from: [http://tldp.org/docs.html#man]
       Linux Man Pages. Since man pages are bundled with software there
       is no LDP template at this time.
     * FAQs. FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) are a list of questions
       and answers to help prevent new users from asking the same
       questions over and over again. A full list of FAQs is available
       from: Linux Documentation Project FAQs. FAQs typically use the
       "article" template with some specific DocBook elements to form
       the Question/Answer structure. You can find a template for
       writing a FAQ in Appendix A.

   Note mini-HOWTOs and HOWTOs


   The LDP no longer distinguishes between HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs. All
   previously written mini-HOWTOs have been included in longer HOWTOs.
   All new documents must be at least HOWTO in length. This means the
   documents should cover a bigger subject area rather than a small one.
   If your document is very small you may wish to submit it for
   inclusion in another, larger HOWTO that already exists. If you're not
   sure what size your document is, email the discuss list and ask for
   feedback.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.3. Unmaintained and Out-of-date Documents

   If you wish to become the "owner" for an unmaintained document there
   are several steps you must go through.

     * Contact the author. Make sure the author no longer wishes to
       maintain the document in question. Note that the E-mail address
       shown may no longer be valid. In that case, try a
       [http://google.com] search for the author. If the original author
       of a document cannot be found after a "good-faith" effort, let us
       know (<discuss@en.tldp.org>--subscription required).
     * Determine if a more up-to-date copy of the document exists,
       outside of what is available on the LDP. If so, try to secure a
       copy for yourself to work on.
     * Inform the LDP which document you would like to maintain, so that
       we can track who is working on what and prevent duplication of
       effort. We also suggest that you join the LDP general discussion
       list (<discuss@en.tldp.org>). This step is also required for new
       documents.
     * Submit the document to the LDP with any intended modifications.
       Make sure to continue to reference the original author somewhere
       within the document (Credits, Revision History, etc.). Once the
       document is re-submitted, we will remove the entry from the list
       of unmaintained documents.

   Note Feedback wanted


   Some of unmaintained documents may be outdated, or the content may be
   covered in another (actively maintained) HOWTO. If that is the
   situation, contact us (preferably on the discuss mailing list) and
   let us know.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.4. Developing an Outline

   Before you actually begin writing, prepare an outline. An outline
   will help you to get a clear picture of the subject matter and allow
   you to concentrate on one small part of the HOWTO at a time.

   Unless your HOWTO is exceptionally small, your outline will probably
   be multilevel. When developing a multilevel outline, the top level
   should contain general subject areas, and sub-headings should be more
   detailed and specific. Look at each level of your outline
   independently, and make sure it covers all key areas of the subject
   matter. Sub-headings should cover all key areas of the heading under
   which they fall.

   Each item in your outline should follow the item before it, and lead
   into the item that comes next. For example, a HOWTO about a
   particular program shouldn't have a section on configuration before
   one on installation.

   You may choose to use the following outline for a HOWTO about using a
   specific program:

     * development history
     * where to download the software from
     * how to install the software
     * how to configure the software
     * how to use the software

   You may find it helpful to try a little "card sorting" at this stage
   of the writing process. Write all of your mini subject areas onto
   pieces of paper. Now sort these pieces of paper into main headings
   and their sub-sections. It may help to shuffle the slips of paper
   before you start. This will help to give you a fresh set of eyes
   while working.

   When you are comfortable with your outline, look it over once more,
   with a critical eye. Have you covered every relevant topic in
   sufficient detail? Have you not wandered beyond the scope of the
   document? It is a good idea to show your outline to others (including
   The LDP discuss list) to get some feedback. Remember: it is much
   easier to reorganize your document at the outline stage than doing
   this after writing it.

   Tip Writing a HOWTO made easy


   For help writing your HOWTO outline, and getting a head start on the
   markup of your document, check out The LDP HOWTO Generator. Note that
   this is for generating HOWTOs. Templates for FAQs and Guides are
   available in Appendix A.

   Note You're not alone


   You might have noticed a theme developing here. Just like Free
   software, Free documentation is best when you "release early, release
   often." The discuss list includes many experienced LDP authors, and
   you would be wise to seek their advice when making decisions about
   your contribution.
     ________________________________________________________________

3.5. Research

   While you are working on your outline you will most likely research
   your topic--especially to confirm the document you are about to write
   does not yet exist! Here are a few pointers that will keep you from
   pulling out your hair later:

     * Compile your resources as you research. It is almost guaranteed
       you will not remember where to find a critical piece of
       information when you need it most. It will help to bookmark
       important (and even not so important) pages as you go. Make sure
       the bookmark's title reflects why the page is important to you.
       If there are multiple key ideas in one page, you may want to
       bookmark the same page with different titles.
     * Assume your most important resource will disappear. The dreaded
       "Error 404: Page not found". Even if you have bookmarked a page
       it may not be there when you return to it. If a page contains a
       really critical piece of information: make a copy. You may do
       this by creating a text file with the title of the document, the
       author's name, the page's URL and the text of the page into a
       text file on your computer. You might also choose to "print" the
       file to a PDF (save as or convert to PDF format will capture the
       original URL on the page if you're using a smart browser).
     * Start your "Resources" page now. As you find pages of interest
       add them to a Resources document. You may do this by exporting
       your bookmarks or by keeping a separate text file with the
       Resources sorted by sub-category. A little effort now will save
       you a lot of time later.
       There is more information about the DocBook markup of
       bibliographies in Section D.7.
     * Write down subject areas as you go. If you are card sorting you
       may find it particularly useful to write topic cards as you find
       pages that cover that specific topic. At the top of the card
       write the subject area. In the main area of the card write a few
       notes about what you might cover under this topic--include the
       titles of pages that contain important information. If a
       sub-topic gets too big you may want to divide it into multiple
       cards.
     * Separate generic information from version-specific information. A
       new version of the software that you describe might be released
       the day after you release your document. Other things, like where
       to download the software, won't change. Alternatively, you may
       choose to document old problems with specific software as a way
       of encouraging readers to upgrade to the latest version
       available: "Version X of the software is known for a specific
       bug. The bug was fixed as of Version Y."
     * Save all related emails. People will often have interesting
       insight into the problem that you are writing about. Any
       questions that are asked about your topic should be addressed in
       the final document. If you are writing about software make sure
       to ask people what system they are using. Add information in your
       document about which system configurations your instructions have
       been tested on. (Having lots of friends with moderately different
       configurations can be very beneficial!) All of these personal
       experiences can add greatly to your final documentation.
     ________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Write

4.1. Writing the Text

   By now you should have organized your document; you collected bits of
   raw information and inserted them into the outline. Your next
   challenge is to massage all of the raw data you've collected into a
   readable, entertaining and understandable whole. If you are working
   from an existing document make sure any new pieces of information are
   in the best possible places.

   It has taken quite a bit of work to get to the point where you can
   actually start writing, hasn't it? Well, the hard work begins to pay
   off for you now. At this stage, you can begin to really use your
   imagination and creativity to communicate this heap of information.
   Don't be too clever though! Your readers are already struggling with
   new concepts--do not make them struggle to understand your language
   as well.

   There are a number of classic guides to writing--many of which are
   available on-line. Their language will seem old, but the messages are
   still valuable to authors today. These are listed in . Also listed in
   the resources section are a variety of sites that have information
   specific to technical writing.

   The Author Guide wouldn't be complete without mentioning the Plain
   Language movement. Although directed at simplifying government
   documents, Writing user-friendly documents is quite useful. It
   includes before and after writing samples. There's also a PlainTrain
   writing tutorial.

   And any document that discusses writing for the web wouldn't be
   complete without a nod toward [http://www.useit.com] useit.com. The
   following articles may be of specific interest:

     * [http://www.useit.com/papers/webwriting/] Writing for the Web
     * [http://useit.com/alertbox/20030811.html] Information pollution
     * [http://useit.com/alertbox/9703b.html] Be Succinct! (Writing for
       the Web)

   There are many, many resources for writing web documents--a quick web
   search for "web writing" will find lots of resources. Don't get too
   distracted, though: the ultimate goal is to write, not to read about
   writing!
     ________________________________________________________________

4.1.1. Writing Style and Style Guides

   There are a number of industry style guides which define how language
   should be used in documents. A common example for American English is
   the Chicago Manual of Style. It defines things like: whether a period
   (.) should be inside or outside of "quotes"; and the format for
   citing another document. A style guide helps to keep documents
   consistent--most corporations will follow a style guide to format
   media releases and other promotional material. Style guides mays also
   define how words should be spelled (is it color or colour?).

   The LDP does not require a specific style guide; however, you should
   use a consistent style throughout your document. Your document should
   be spell checked for a single language (e.g. American English vs.
   British English). The [http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/]
   Reviewer's HOWTO currently lists a number of conventions for LDP
   documents and it is as close as it gets to an official LDP Style
   Guide.

   Tip A personal glossary


   It helps to make a list of terms that you were new to you when you
   first started researching and writing your document. You can refer to
   this list while writing the text. You may also want to include it as
   a glossary in your final document.

   You can save yourself a lot of time in the editing phase if you
   decide how you will write your document ahead of time. If you are
   taking over someone else's document you may need to either: modify
   your own style to fit the current document; or edit the document so
   that it melds with the style you would like to use from now on.

   From a writing style perspective, use of the first-person in a HOWTO
   adds to its charm--an attribute most other documentation sorely
   lacks. Don't be afraid to speak for yourself--use the word "I" to
   describe your personal experiences and opinions.
     ________________________________________________________________

4.1.2. On-line Writing Resources

   In the section, you will find a list of resources that cover the
   subject better than this guide could hope to. Consult them, and
   follow their advice.
     ________________________________________________________________

4.2. Edit and Proofread the Text

   Once you've written the text of your HOWTO, it is time to polish and
   refine it. Good editing can make the difference between a good HOWTO
   and a great one.

   One of the goals of editing is to remove [extraneous] material that
   has crept its way into your document. You should go through your
   HOWTO carefully, and ruthlessly delete anything that does not
   contribute to the reader's understanding of the subject matter. It is
   natural for writers to go off on tangents while in the process of
   writing. Now is the time to correct that. It often helps to leave a
   bit of time between when you write a document and when you edit it.

   Make sure that the content of every section matches the title
   precisely. It's possible that your original subject heading is no
   longer relevant. If you've strayed from your original heading it
   could mean one of the following: the original title was poorly
   worded, the new material should actually go in a different section,
   or the new material is not really necessary for your document. If you
   need to change a title, check to see if the original subject heading
   is still important. If it is, make sure that topic is covered
   somewhere else in the document.

   When editing and proofing your work, check for obvious mistakes, such
   as spelling errors and typos. You should also check for deeper, but
   less obvious errors as well, such as "holes" in the information. If
   you are creating a set of instructions it may help to test them on a
   new machine. Sometimes there are packages that need to be installed
   which you've forgotten to mention in your documentation, for
   instance.

   When you are completely satisfied with the quality and accuracy of
   your work, forward it to someone else for third-party proofing. You
   will be too close to the work to see fundamental flaws. Have others
   test the instructions as well. Make sure they follow exactly what you
   have written. Ask anyone who tests your documentation to make
   specific notes in any places where they didn't follow your
   instructions (and the reason why they didn't follow them). For
   example: "I skipped step 2 because I already have the required
   packages installed."

   In a sense, editing is like code review in software development.
   Having a programmer review their own code doesn't make much sense,
   and neither does having a writer edit their own document. Recruit a
   friend, or write the discuss list to find a volunteer to proofread
   before submitting your document. You may also want to submit your
   document to a mailing list that is relevant to your document's topic.
   List members should be able to help check the facts, clarity of your
   instructions and language of the document.

   Note Native speaker?


   If you are writing in a language in which you are not fluent, find an
   editor who is. Technical documentation, more than any other type of
   writing, must use extremely precise grammar and vocabulary. Misuse of
   language makes your document less valuable.
     ________________________________________________________________

4.3. Tools for Writing, Editing and Maintaining your Document

   Caution Reminder


   You do not need to submit your initial document to the LDP in
   anything more than plain text! Other open submission formats are
   accepted as well, for instance OpenOffice documents, RTF files or
   HTML. The LDP volunteers will convert your document to DocBook for
   you. Once it has been converted you will need to maintain your
   document in DocBook format, but that should be obvious.
     ________________________________________________________________

4.3.1. Editing Tools

   You may use any word processing or text editing tool to write your
   initial document. When you get to the markup stage you may want to
   use a text editor which recognizes DocBook files. At a minimum a
   program which adds syntax highlighting to your markup will make life
   a lot easier. For a description of editors which can handle DocBook
   files please skip to Section B.2.
     ________________________________________________________________

4.3.2. Concurrent Versions System (CVS)

   The LDP provides optional CVS access to its authors. This enables
   collaborative writing and has the following positive effects:

    1. CVS will keep an off-site backup of your documents. In the event
       that you hand over a document to another author, they can just
       retrieve the document from CVS and continue on. In the event you
       need to go back to a previous version of a document, you can
       retrieve it as well.
    2. However difficult from an organizational point of view, it's
       great to have multiple people working on the same document. CVS
       enables you to do this. You can have CVS tell you what changes
       were made by another author while you were editing your copy, and
       integrate those changes.
    3. CVS keeps a log of what changes were made. These logs (and a date
       stamp) can be placed automatically inside your documents when
       they are published.
    4. CVS can be combined with scripts to automatically update the LDP
       web site with new documentation as it's written and submitted.
       This is not in place yet, but it is a goal. Currently, CVS
       updates signal the HOWTO coordinator to update the LDP web page,
       meaning that if you use CVS, you're not required to e-mail your
       XML code. (Although you do still need to send the submit list an
       email when you are ready for your document to be published,
       because the whole publishing process has not been fully automated
       yet.)

   Note Access to our CVS repository


   Only authors with at least three submissions get access to our CVS,
   see Appendix C.

   For more information on how to use CVS to maintain your LDP
   documents, please read Appendix C.
     ________________________________________________________________

4.3.3. Spell Check

   Some writing tools will come with their own built-in spell check
   tools. This list is only if your application does not have a spell
   check option.

   Spell Check Software

   aspell [http://aspell.sourceforge.net] http://aspell.sourceforge.net
          This spell check application can work around XML tags. By
          distinguishing between content and markup aspell is able to
          check your content and ignore the bits it shouldn't be looking
          at. If you are getting spelling errors in your markup tags you
          may be using an old version and should upgrade.

          The aspell command comes with the aspell package, included on
          most Linux distributions. Use the command as follows:

          aspell -c file

          An interactive user interface allows for fast and easy
          correction of errors. Use the --help to read more about aspell
          features.

   ispell [http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/ispell.html]
          http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~geoff/ispell.html
          Similar to aspell, but tries to spell check your markup tags.
          If you have a choice, use aspell, if not, ispell is a very
          acceptable substitute.
     ________________________________________________________________

Chapter 5. Markup

5.1. Markup: A General Overview

   A markup language is a system for marking or tagging a document to
   define the structure of the document. You may add tags to your
   document to define which parts of your document are paragraphs,
   titles, sections, glossary items (the list goes on!). There are many
   markup languages in use today. XHTML and HTML will be familiar to
   those who author web documents. The LDP uses a markup language known
   as DocBook. Each of these markup languages uses its own "controlled
   vocabulary" to describe documents. For example: in XHTML a paragraph
   would be marked up with the tagset <p></p> while in DocBook a
   paragraph would be marked up with <para></para>. The tagsets are
   defined in a quasi dictionary known as a Document Type Definition
   (DTD).

   Markup languages also follow a set of rules on how a document can be
   assembled. The rules are either SGML (Standard Generalized Markup
   Language) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language). These rules are
   essentially the "grammar" of a document's markup. SGML and XML are
   very similiar. XML is a sub-set of SGML, but XML requires more
   precise use of the tags when marking up a document. The LDP accepts
   both SGML and XML documents, but prefers XML.

   There are three components to an XML/SGML document which is read by a
   person.

     * Content. As a TLDP author it is good to remember that this is the
       most important piece. Many authors will write the content first
       and add their markup later. Content may include both plain text
       and graphics. This is the only part that is required of LDP
       authors!
     * Markup. To describe the structure of a document a controlled
       vocabulary is added on top of the content. It is used to
       distinguish different kinds of content: paragraphs, lists,
       tables, warnings (and so on). The markup must also conform to
       either SGML or XML rules. If you are not comfortable adding
       markup to your document, a TLDP volunteer will do it for you.
     * Transformation. Finally the document is transformed from DocBook
       to PDF, HTML, PostScript for display in digital or paper form.
       This transformation is controlled through the Document Style
       Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL). The DSSSL tells the
       program doing the transformation how to convert the raw markup
       into something that a human can read. The LDP uses a series of
       scripts to automate these transformations. You are not required
       to transform your own documents.

   Note Content, markup and transformations


   Steve Champeon does a great job of explaining how content, markup
   languages, and transformations all fit together in his article The
   Secret Life of Markup. Although he is writing from an HTML
   perspective, the ideas are relevant and there is an example of
   DocBook markup.
     ________________________________________________________________

5.2. DocBook: What it is and why we use it

   According to the official DocBook web site,


   DocBook is a general purpose XML and SGML document type particularly
   well suited to books and papers about computer hardware and software
   (though it is by no means limited to these applications).

   --DocBook.org

   Tip For the impatient


   In the next sections we will be explaining about the theoretical side
   of DocBook, its origins, development, advantages and disadvantages.
   If you just want the practical side, check out these sections for an
   overview of HOWTO DocBook: , Appendix D, and Appendix E from this
   guide.

   Caution For the beginner


   We wish to stress again the fact that any open document format will
   be accepted. If you feel more comfortable with plain text, OpenOffice
   or HTML, that is fine with us. If you do not look forward to learning
   DocBook, LDP volunteerd will convert your document to DocBook XML. To
   us, the most important task for our authors is the actual writing,
   not the formatting, keep that in mind!

   From the point of submission onwards, however, you will have to
   maintain your document in this XML format, but that's a piece of
   cake. Promised.

   Although there are other DTDs used to write documentation, there are
   a few reasons not to use them.

     * DocBook is the most popular DTD, being used by more than a dozen
       major open source projects from GNOME to Python to FreeBSD.
     * The tools for DocBook are more developed than others. DocBook
       support is included in most Linux distributions, allowing you to
       send raw files to be processed at the receiver's end.
     * And finally, DocBook has an extensive set of tags (over 300 in
       all) which is very useful when you are trying to describe the
       content of a document. Fortunately for new authors the majority
       of them do not need to be used for simple documentation.

   Still not convinced? Eric Raymond has written a DocBook
   Demystification HOWTO which may help.

   Convinced, but still not comfortable with the thought of working with
   DocBook? Give David Lawyer's
   [http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Howtos-with-LinuxDoc.html]
   Howtos-with-LinuxDoc-mini-HOWTO a try.
     ________________________________________________________________

5.3. XML and SGML: Why we use XML

   DocBook comes in a couple of different flavors--including both XML
   and SGML formats. This means that you may use either the SGML
   grammar/rules when adding markup, or you may use the XML
   grammar/rules. Either way you may only use one set of rules
   throughout your document, and you must define which one you are using
   at the top of your document.

   The LDP prefers the XML flavor of DocBook. There are a number of
   reasons for this including the following:

    1. Libraries for handling XML files are developing at a rapid pace.
       These utilities may make it easier for new authoring tools to
       become available.
    2. Many popular word processing programs are now creating XML
       output. While it may not be DocBook XML, this does make it easier
       for application writers to either add DocBook XML support, or
       provide some method of translating between their format and
       DocBook XML.
    3. Everyone else is doing it. While this might not be a real reason,
       it allows the LDP to keep up-to-date with similar projects.
       Tools, procedures, and issues can be worked out in a common
       framework.

   Still not convinced? Fortunately the LDP does accept a number of
   other file formats for input. The list of accepted markup languages
   can be found in Section 5.4
     ________________________________________________________________

5.4. Markup Languages Accepted by TLDP

   The LDP stores its documents in the following markup languages:

    1. DocBook XML version 4.2 (preferred), 4.1.2
    2. DocBook SGML version 4.2, 4.1, or 3.x
    3. LinuxDoc SGML

   Note New Documents


   A new document may be submitted to the LDP in any format. Documents
   which are not in DocBook or LinuxDoc will be converted by a
   volunteer. The author is responsible for adding markup to any
   revisions which are made.
     ________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Distributing Your Documentation

6.1. Before Distributing Your Documentation

   Before you distribute your documentation, there are a few more things
   that you will need to check and possibly add to your document.

   Spelling and Grammar Check
          You can read more about helper applications in Section 4.3.3.
          You should also check your document for its overall flow and
          clarity.

   Abstract and Other Meta Data
          Add a short paragraph which clearly defines the scope of your
          document. For more information on how to add this information
          using DocBook please read Section D.6

   Acknowledgments
          Give credit where credit is due. For more information about
          when to give credit, read Section 6.3.

   License and Copyright
          The LDP distributes documents, however, the author maintains
          the copyright on the document. All documents accepted by the
          LDP must contain a license and copyright notice. You can read
          more about this in Section 6.2.1. You may also want to add a
          Disclaimer, but this is optional. More about this in Section
          6.2.2.

   Validate the Markup
          If you are submitting a DocBook or LinuxDoc document, make
          sure the markup is valid. Read why in Section B.3.1.

   Obtain Peer Reviews
          You may want to have others review your document before
          submitting it to the LDP. Ask people for a Peer Review and/or
          a Technical Accuracy Review. Since not all mailing lists will
          respond favorably to attachments, you may wish to set up a
          temporary web site which houses your document. Note: this is
          absolutely not required.
     ________________________________________________________________

6.2. Licensing and Copyright

   In order for a document to be accepted by the LDP, it must be
   licensed and conform to the "LICENSE REQUIREMENTS" section of the LDP
   Manifesto located at [http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html]
   http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html.

   We recommend using the GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL), one of
   the Creative Commons Licenses
   ([http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sa/1.0/] Share-Alike, or
   [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/]
   Attribution-Share-Alike), or the LDP license (currently under
   review). The full text of the license must be included in your
   document, including the title and version of the license you are
   using. The LDP will not accept new documents that do not meet
   licensing requirements.

   Warning Debian-compatible licenses


   The Debian package maintainer for LDP documents has divided the LDP
   documents into those with a "free" license and those with a
   "non-free" license. For a summary of this list, please read
   [http://www.debian.org/legal/licenses/byname] Debian License
   Summaries. Currently the Artistic License, BSD License and the GNU
   General Public License are listed as "free". These licenses will also
   be accepted by the LDP. The definition of "non-free" has not been
   made transparent. By choosing another license that has any kind of
   restriction on redistribution or whether or not the document may be
   modified, your document may be put into the "non-free" package
   instead of the "free" package. We are working with Debian to clarify
   how these decisions are made.

   You can get DocBook markups of both the GNU GPL and the GNU FDL from
   [http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gdp/licenses.html] the GNOME
   Documentation Project. You can then merely include the license in its
   entirety in your document. A DocBook-formatted copy of the license is
   available in Appendix A.

   For more information about open source documentation and licensing,

6.2.1. Copyright

   As an author, you may retain the copyright and add other restrictions
   (for example: require approval for any translations or derivative
   works). If you are a new maintainer of an already-existing HOWTO, you
   must include the previous copyright statements of the previous
   author(s) and the dates they maintained that document.
     ________________________________________________________________

6.2.2. Disclaimer

   If you would like to include a disclaimer, you may choose to use the
   following:

     No liability for the contents of this document can be accepted.
     Use the concepts, examples and information at your own risk. There
     may be errors and inaccuracies, that could be damaging to your
     system. Proceed with caution, and although it is highly unlikely
     that accidents will happen because of following advice or
     procedures described in this document, the author(s) do not take
     any responsibility for any damage claimed to be caused by doing
     so.

     All copyrights are held by their by their respective owners,
     unless specifically noted otherwise. Use of a term in this
     document should not be regarded as affecting the validity of any
     trademark or service mark. Naming of particular products or brands
     should not be seen as endorsements.
     ________________________________________________________________

6.2.3. Licensing source code

   If your HOWTO includes bits of source code that you want others to
   use, you may choose to release the source code under GPL.
     ________________________________________________________________

6.3. Acknowledgments

   Your document should have an "Acknowledgments" section, in which you
   mention everyone who has contributed to your document in any
   meaningful way. You should include translators and converters, as
   well as people who have sent you lots of good feedback, perhaps the
   person who taught you the knowledge you are now passing on, and
   anybody else who was instrumental in making the document what it is.
   Most authors put this section at the end of their document.

   When someone else assists in the production of an LDP document, you
   should give them proper attribution, and there are DocBook tags
   designed to do this. This section will show you the tags you should
   use, as well as other ways of giving credit where credit is due.
   Crediting editors is easy - there is already an <editor>tag in
   DocBook. But there are two special cases where you need to credit
   someone, but DocBook doesn't provide a special tag. These are
   translators and converters.

   A converter is someone who performs a source code conversion, for
   instance from HTML to DocBook XML. Source code conversions help the
   LDP achieve long term goals for meta-data, and allow us to distribute
   documentation in many different formats.

   Translators take your original document and translate it into other
   human-readable languages, from English to Japanese for example, or
   from German to English. Each translation allows many more people all
   over the world to make use of your document and of the Linux
   operating system!

   We recommend that you acknowledge converters in the comment for the
   initial version released in the new format, and we recommend that you
   credit translators in each version which they have translated.

   Note Acknowledgments translated in DocBook


   For more information on how to add these credits using DocBook please
   read Section D.6
     ________________________________________________________________

6.4. TLDP Review Process

   Before your document is accepted to the LDP collection it will
   undergo at least three formal reviews. These reviews include a
   technical accuracy review, a language review and a metadata review.
   All new documents must pass these reviews before being accepted into
   the collection.

   When you feel your document is finished, email a copy to the submit
   mailing list (<submit@en.tldp.org>). Please include the title of your
   document and "Final Review Required" in the subject line of your
   email. A team of volunteers will be assigned to your document for
   each of the reviews. It may take up to a week to gather a team who is
   qualified to review your document. Typically the technical review
   happens first, followed by the language review and finally the
   metadata review. Your reviewers will read your document give you
   feedback on whether or not they think your document is ready for
   publication in the LDP collection.

   Your reviewers may have specific points that must be changed. Once
   you have made the changes submit your document back to your review
   team. They will review the document again and advise you on whether
   or not your document is ready for inclusion in the LDP collection.
   You may need to undergo several edits before your document is ready.
   Or it may not require any additional work. Be prepared to make at
   least one round of changes for both the technical and language
   reviews. Ideally this exchange will happen in the LDP's
   [http://cvs.tldp.org] CVS to better track each of the changes that
   are made, and keep track of the most current version of your
   document.

   Once your document has passed both the technical and language
   reviews, you may submit it by following the instructions in Section
   6.5.

   Tip Comparing Two Source Files


   Your reviewer may make changes directly to your source file, or they
   may put their suggestions in a separate email. If they are working
   with the source file directly, and your document is using DocBook
   XML, you may find XMLdiff useful to see the changes that your
   reviewer has made to your source file. It is a python tool that
   figures out the differences between two similar XML files, in the
   same way the diff utility compares text files.

   XMLdiff is available from [http://www.logilab.org/projects/xmldiff]
   http://www.logilab.org/projects/xmldiff.

   For more information on what the reviewers will be looking for,
   please read the
   [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/index.html] Linux
   Documentation Project Reviewer HOWTO.
     ________________________________________________________________

6.5. Submission to LDP for publication

   Note The final step


   This section contains information on what to do after your document
   has received both a technical and language review by the LDP
   volunteers.

   As part of the review process a Review Coordinator will add your
   document to the CVS (including any associated image files) and notify
   the submit mailing list that your document is ready for publication.

   If you do not already have a CVS account, please apply for one when
   your document is submitted for publication. You can apply for an
   account contacting LDP CVS master Sergiusz [mailto:ser@gnu.org]
   mailto:ser@gnu.org
     ________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Maintenance

7.1. Maintaining Your Document

   Just because your document has now been published does not mean your
   job is done. Linux documentation needs regular maintenance to make
   sure it is up to date, and to improve it in response to readers'
   ideas and suggestions. TLDP is a living, growing body of knowledge,
   not just a publish-and-forget-it static entity.

   Add relevant mailing lists to your document where people can get
   support. If you have the time, follow these mailing lists yourself to
   stay up-to-date on the latest information.

   Put your email address in the document, and politely request feedback
   from your readers. Once you are officially published, you will begin
   to receive notes with suggestions. Some of these emails will be very
   valuable. Create a folder in your mail program for incoming
   suggestions--when the time is right review the folder and make
   updates to your document. If you are following a related mailing list
   you may also choose to save a copy of important emails from the list
   to this folder.

   Note We are not a free support service, but...


   Some people who email you will request personal assistance. You
   should feel free to decline personal assistance if you cannot spare
   the time. Writing a contribution to the LDP does not commit you to a
   lifetime of free support for anyone on the net; however, do try to
   reply to all requests and suggest a mailing list that will
   (hopefully) be able to provide support to your reader.
     ________________________________________________________________

7.2. Fixing Errors

7.2.1. Fixing Your Own Documents

   If you find an error in your own document, please fix it and
   re-submit the document. You can re-submit your files by emailing them
   to <submit@en.tldp.org>.

   If you have been using the CVS, you can submit your changes to the
   CVS tree and then send a note to the submit mailing list
   (<submit@en.tldp.org>). In your email please give the exact path of
   your document in the CVS tree.

   Remember to update the revision history at the top of the document.
     ________________________________________________________________

7.2.2. Fixing Other Documents in the Collection

   If you find an error in someone else's document please contact the
   author of the document with the correction. If you do not hear back
   from the author within a "reasonable" amount of time, please email
   the LDP coordinator at <discuss@en.tldp.org>
   ([http://tldp.org/mailinfo.html#maillists] subscription required) and
   describe the problem and how you think it needs to be fixed. If the
   license permits, you may be asked to make the change directly to the
   document. If the problems are serious, the document may be removed
   from the collection, or moved to the "Unmaintained" section.

   Note Taking over unmaintained documentation


   For more information on how to deal with unmaintained documents,
   please read: [http://www.tldp.org/authors/unmaint.html] Unmaintained
   (includes a list of steps to take to take over "ownership" of
   unmaintained documents, and a list of unmaintained documents).

   get new docbook authors, editors, and contributors up and running
   fast with the DoocBook tools. These are powerful tool in the hands of
   an author. It assumes a fair knowledge of building and installing
   source packages. There are probably a million and one ways to
   accomplish my ultimate goal of installing and using these tools. This
   one works well for me.

   http://www.catb.org/~esr/Licensing-HOWTO.html, Eric Raymond,
   Catherine Raymond.



   This document explains how U.S. copyright and licensing law applies
   to open-source software projects. It compares the strengths and
   weaknesses of the existing open-source licenses, and gives guidance
   on how to choose a license for your project. It also explains the
   legalities of changing a project's license. It suggests new practice
   for coping with today's high-threat legal environment--this part is a
   must-read for all project leaders.

Appendix B. System Setup: Editors, Validation and Transformations

   In this section, we will cover some of the tools that you may want to
   use to create your own LDP documentation. If you use some other tool
   to assist you in writing documents for the LDP, please drop us a line
   and we'll add a blurb for it here. Section 1.3 has contact
   information.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.1. Tools for your operating system

   A few notes on setting up your system for DocBook publishing. These
   tools focus more on the transformation of documents from DocBook to
   XHTML (for example).

   Tools For Your Operating System

   Debian
          http://www.docbook.org/wiki/moin.cgi/DebianGnuLinuxPackages

          [http://www.surgo.net] Morgon Kanter suggests apt-get install
          docbook-xml docbook-xsl xsltproc as the minimum requirements.
          [http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:4851]
          http://lists.tldp.org/index.cgi?1:mss:4851

   Fedora (aka the new RedHat)
          Notes contributed by Charles Curley.

          Tools for Docbook SGML and XML are included in the
          distrubution. So are Emacs and PSGML mode, although you will
          have to customize your .emacs. If you are missing a package
          after installing Fedora, get familiar with yum or apt.

          Installation instructions: none; use Red Hat 9 until they are
          written:
          [http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/]
          http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/linux/RHL-9-Manual/.

   Mandrake
          Notes contributed by [http://www.artemio.net] Artemio.

          In Mandrake (as of my current 9.2), all the stuff including
          openjade, xmlto, docbook-utils etc. comes as standard.

          So I just needed to get the TLDP XSL sheet and that's all.
          Didn't ever have any dependency or other problems, everything
          works fine (knock on wood :-)).

   RedHat
          According to Hal Burgiss, your system is likely already ready
          to edit and process DocBook documents without installing any
          additional packages.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2. Editing tools

   Editing tools have come a long way in their support for XML (and
   specifically DocBook). There are two types of editors outlined in
   this section: text editors (emacs, vim, etc); and word processors
   (OpenOffice, AbiWord, etc). New authors who are not comfortable
   working with markup languages should probably choose a word processor
   that can output DocBook files. For this reason the word processors
   are listed first.

   Although many editors can also validate your DocBook files, this
   information has been separated into Section B.3.

   Note More info


   Check the resources section for more .
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1. Word Processors

   Even if you are not comfortable working DocBook's tagset in a text
   editor you can still produce valid DocBook documents using a word
   processor. Support at this point is very limited, but it does exist
   in the following programs. The up side, of course, is that things
   like spell check are built in to the program. In addition to this,
   support for DocBook (and XML) is constantly improving.

   Note Converting Microsoft Word documents


   Even if you want to use MS Word to write your documents, you may find
   [http://www.docsoft.com/w2xmlv2.htm] w2XML useful. Note that this is
   not free software--the cost is around $130USD. There is, however, a
   trial version of the software.

   Note Work on the content!


   Remember that all formatting changes you make to your document will
   be ignored when your document is released by the LDP. Instead of
   focusing on how your document looks, focus on the content.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.1. AbiWord

   Through word of mouth I've heard that AbiWord can work (natively)
   with DocBook documents. This will need to be tested by someone
   (possibly me) and should definitely be included if it is the case.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.2. OpenOffice.org

   [http://openoffice.org] http://openoffice.org

   As of OpenOffice.org (OOo) 1.1RC there has been support for exporting
   files to DocBook format.

   Although OOo uses the full DocBook document type declaration, it does
   not actually export the full list of DocBook elements. It uses a
   "simplified" DocBook tagset which is geared to on-the-fly rendering.
   (Although it is not the official Simplified DocBook which is
   described in Section B.5.) The OpenOffice simplified (or "special"
   docbook) is available from
   [http://xml.openoffice.org/xmerge/docbook/supported_tag_table.html]
   http://xml.openoffice.org/xmerge/docbook/supported_tag_table.html.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.2.1. Open Office 1.0.x

   OOo has been tested by LDP volunteers with mostly positive results.
   Thanks to Charles Curley ([http://www.charlescurley.com]
   charlescurley.com) for the following notes on using OOo version
   1.0.x:

   Note Check the version of your OpenOffice


   These notes may not apply to the version of OOo you are using.

     * To be able to export to DocBook, you must have a Java runtime
       environment (JRE) installed and registered with OOo--a minimum of
       version 4.2.x is recommended. The configuration instructions will
       depend on how you installed your JRE. Visit the OOo web site for
       help with your setup.
       Contrary to the OOo documentation, the Linux OOo did not come
       with a JRE. I got one from Sun.
     * The exported file has lots of empty lines. My 54 line exported
       file had 5 lines of actual XML code.
     * There was no effort at pretty printing.
     * The header is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE
       article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
       "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd">
     * The pull-down menu in the File->Save As dialog box for file
       format indicates that the export format is "DocBook
       (simplified)." There is no explanation of what that "simplified"
       indicates. Does OOo export a subset of DocBook? If so, which
       elements are ignored? Is there any way to enter any of them
       manually?
     * There is NO documentation on the DocBook export filter or whether
       OOo will import it again.

   Conclusions: OOo 1.1RC is worth looking at if you want a word
   processor for preparing DocBook documents.

   However, I hope they cure the lack of documentation. For one thing,
   it would be nice to know which native OOo styles map to which DocBook
   elements. It would also be nice to know how to map one's own OOo
   styles to DocBook elements.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.2.2. Open Office 1.1

   [http://www.merlinmonroe.com] Tabatha Marshall offers the following
   additional information for OOo 1.1.

     The first problem was when I tried to do everything on version
     1.0.1. That was obviously a problem. I have RH8, and it was
     installed via rpm packages, so I ripped it out and did a full, new
     install of OpenOffice 1.1. It took a while to find out 1.1 was a
     requirement for XML to work.

     During the install process I believe I was offered the choice to
     install the XML features. I have a tendency to do full installs of
     my office programs, so I selected everything.

     I can't offer any advice to those trying to update their current
     OO 1.1. Their "3 ways" aren't documented very well at the site
     ([http://xml.openoffice.org] xml.openoffice.org) and as of this
     writing, I can't even find THAT on their site anymore. I think
     more current documentation is needed there to walk people through
     the process. Most of this was unclear and I had to pretty much
     experiment to get things working.

     Well, after I installed everything I had some configuration to do.
     I opened the application, and got started by opening a new file,
     choosing templates, then selecting the DocBook template. A nice
     menu of Paragraph Styles popped up for me, which are the names for
     all those tags, I noticed (you can see I don't use WYSIWYG often).

     With a blank doc before me (couldn't get to the XML Filter
     Settings menu unless some type of doc was opened), I went into
     Tools->XML Filter Settings, and edited the entry for DocBook file.
     I configured mine as follows:

     * Doctype -//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN
     * DTD http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd
     * XSLT for export
       /usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.1.0/share/xslt/docbook/ldp-html.xsl
     * XSLT for import
       /usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.1.0/share/xslt/docbook/docbooktosoffhe
       adings.xsl (this is the default)
     * Template for import
       /home/tabatha/OpenOffice/user/template/DocBook
       File/DocBookTemplate.stw

     At first, if I opened an XML file that had even one parsing error,
     it would just open the file anyway and display the markup in OO. I
     have many XML files that use &copy; and other types of entities
     which show up as parse errors (depending on the encoding) even
     though they can be processed through. But today I was unable to
     open any of those files. I got input/output errors instead. Still
     investigating that one.

     However when you do successfully open a document (one parsing with
     no errors), it puts it automatically into WYSIWYG based on the
     markup, and you can then work from the paragraph styles menu like
     any other such editor.

     To validate the document, I used Tools->XML Filter Settings, then
     clicked the Test XSLTs button. On my screen, I set up the XSLT for
     export to be ldp-html.xsl. If you test and there are errors, a new
     window pops up with error messages at the bottom, and the lines
     that need to be changed up at the top. You can change them there
     and progress through the errors until they're all gone, and keep
     testing until they're gone.

     If you want to open a file to see the source instead of the
     processed results, go to Tools->XML Filter Settings->Test XSLTs,
     and then under the Import section, check the Display Source box.
     My import XSLT is currently docbooktosoffheadings.xsl (the
     default) and the template for import is DocBookTemplate.stw (also
     default).

     I think this might work for some people, but unfortunately not for
     me. I've never used WYSIWYG to edit markup. Emacs with PSGML can
     tell me what my next tag is no matter where I am, validate by
     moving through the trouble spots, and I can parse and process from
     command line.

     With OpenOffice, you have to visit
     [http://xml.openoffice.org/filters.html]
     http://xml.openoffice.org/filters.html to find conversion tools.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.3. WordPerfect 9 (Corel Office 2000)

   [http://www.corel.com/] http://www.corel.com/

   WordPerfect 9 for the MS Windows platform has support for SGML and
   DocBook 3.0. WordPerfect 9 for Linux has no SGML capabilities.

   If you are using WordPerfect on the Linux operating system, please
   read: WordPerfect on Linux FAQ
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.4. XMLmind's XML editor

   [http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/] http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/

   Although strictly speaking, it is not a word processor, XMLmind's XML
   editor allows authors to concentrate on the content, and not the
   markup. It has built in spelling and conversion utilities which allow
   you to transform your documents without having to install and
   configure an additional processing tool such as jade. There is a free
   "standard edition", which is a simplified version of their
   "professional edition."
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.5. Conglomerate

   [http://www.conglomerate.org] http://www.conglomerate.org

   According to their web site, "Conglomerate aims to be an XML editor
   that everyone can use. In particular, our primary goal is to create
   the ultimate editor for DocBook and similar formats. It aims to hide
   the jargon and complexity of XML and present the information in your
   documents in a way that makes sense."
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.6. Vex: a visual editor for XML

   [http://vex.sourceforge.net/] http://vex.sourceforge.net/

   According to their web site, "The visual part comes from the fact
   that Vex hides the raw XML tags from the user, providing instead a
   wordprocessor-like interface. Because of this, Vex is best suited for
   document-style XML documents such as XHTML and DocBook rather than
   data-style XML documents."
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2. Text Editors

   Caution For advanced writers


   The tools outlined in this section allow you to work with the DocBook
   tags directly. If you are not comfortable working with markup
   languages you may want to use a word processor instead. Word
   processors that support DocBook are described in Section B.2.1.

   If you are comfortable working with markup languages and text
   editors, you'll probably want to customize your current editor of
   choice to handle DocBook files. Below are some of the more common
   text editors that can, with some tweaking, handle DocBook files.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.1. Emacs (PSGML)

   http://www.lysator.liu.se/~lenst/about_psgml/

   Emacs has an SGML writing mode called psgml that is a major mode
   designed for editing SGML and XML documents. It provides:

     * "syntax highlighting" or "pretty printing" features that make the
       tags stand out
     * a way to insert tags other than typing them by hand
     * and the ability to validate your document while writing

   For users of Emacs, it's a great way to go. PSGML works with DocBook,
   LinuxDoc and other DTDs equally well.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.1.1. Verifying PSGML is Installed

   If you have installed a recent distribution, you may already have
   PSGML installed for use with Emacs. To check, start Emacs and look
   for the PSGML documentation (C-himpsgml).

   Tip Dependencies


   If you don't have PSGML installed now might be a good time to upgrade
   Emacs. The rest of these instructions will assume you have PSGML
   installed.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.1.2. Configuring Emacs for Use With PSGML

   If you want GNU Emacs to enter PSGML mode when you open an .xml file,
   it will need to be able to find the DocBook DTD files. If your
   distribution already had PSGML set up for use with GNU Emacs, you
   probably won't need to do anything.

   Note Tuning Emacs


   For more information on how to configure Emacs, check out .

   Once you've configured your system to use PSGML you will need to
   override Emacs' default sgml-mode with the psgml-mode. This can be
   done by configuring your .emacs file. After you've edited the
   configuration file you will need to restart Emacs.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.1.3. Creating New DocBook XML Files

   There are a number of steps to creating a new DocBook XML file in
   Emacs.

     * Create a new file with an xml extension.
     * On the first line of the file enter the doctype for the version
       of DocBook that you would like to use. If you're not sure what a
       doctype is all about, check Section B.5
     * Enter C-c C-p. If Emacs manages to parse your DTD, you will see
       Parsing prolog...done in the minibuffer.
     * Enter C-c C-e Enter to auto-magically insert the parent element
       for your document. (New authors are typically writing articles.)
     * If things are working correctly, you should see new tags for the
       parent element for your document right after the document type
       declaration. In other words you should now see two extra tags:
       <article> and </article> in your document.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.1.4. Spell Checking in Emacs

   Emacs can be configured to use aspell by adding the following to your
   ~/.emacs file. Thanks to [http://www.ertius.org] Rob Weir for this
   configuration information.
;; Use aspell
(setq-default ispell-program-name "aspell")
;;Setup some dictionary languages
(setq ispell-dictionary "british")
(setq flyspell-default-dictionary "british")
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.2. epcEdit

   [http://www.tksgml.de/] http://www.tksgml.de

   The epcEdit program allows you to edit XML files. It has the
   advantages of not needing to know Emacs or vi before starting, and is
   cross-platform, working in both Windows and Linux. This is a
   commercial application, and pricing can be found at
   [http://www.tksgml.de/pricing.html] http://www.tksgml.de/pricing.html

   Along with visual editing, epcEdit will also validate documents on
   loading, and on demand by using the Document->Validate command.

   Figure B-1. epcEdit screen shot

   [sgeditscreenshot.jpg]
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.3. Morphon XML editor

   [http://www.morphon.com/xmleditor/index.shtml]
   http://www.morphon.com/xmleditor/index.shtml

   This is a commercial application which is currently available for
   free (with an optional user registration). It is written in Java,
   allowing it to run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine
   (that is, works in both Windows and Linux).

   On the plus sides of XMLEditor is the left side of the screen shows
   the hierarchy of the document (starting with Book and so on).
   Selecting an item in the list brings you to that part of the document
   so you can edit it. The right part of the screen shows the text
   without any markup or tags being shown. If you have external files as
   ELEMENTS (as the LDP Author Guide does), XMLEditor will follow the
   links and load the files, so you always work on the entire work. On
   the minus side of this, you will get errors if a file is missing.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.4. nedit

   [http://nedit.org] http://nedit.org

   To be fair, nedit is more for programmers, so it might seem a bit of
   overkill for new users and especially non-programmers. All that
   aside, it's extremely powerful, allowing for syntax highlighting.
   Unlike epcEdit, nedit doesn't allow you to automatically insert tags
   or automatically validate your code. However, it does allow for shell
   commands to be run against the contents of the window (as opposed to
   saving the file, then checking).

   Figure B-2. nedit screen shot

   [neditscreenshot.jpg]
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.4.1. Using nedit

   When you open your DocBook file, nedit should already have syntax
   highlighting enabled. If it does not you can turn it on explicitly
   using: Preferences->Language Mode->SGML HTML

   If you have line numbers turned on (using Preferences->Show Line
   Numbers) then finding validation errors is much simpler. nsgmls, the
   validation tool we'll use, lists errors by their line number.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.4.2. Configuring nedit

   Since you can feed the contents of your window to outside programs,
   you can easily extend nedit to perform repetitive functions. The
   example you'll see here is to validate your document using nsgmls.
   For more information about nsgmls and validating documents please
   read Section B.3.

     * Select Preferences->Default Settings->Customize Menus->Shell
       Menu.... This will bring up the Shell Command dialog box, with
       all the shell commands nedit has listed under the Shell menu.
     * Under Menu Entry, enter "Validate DocBook." This will be the
       entry you'll see on the screen.
     * Under Accelerator, press Alt-S. Once this menu item is set up,
       you can press Alt-S to have the Validate DocBook automatically
       run.
     * Under Command Input, select window, and under Command Output,
       select dialog.
     * Under Command to Execute, enter nsgmls -sv. Using -v outputs the
       version number is output to the screen so that you know the
       command has run.

       Note Check the PATH


   Note that nsgmls has to be in your PATH for this to work properly.

   Figure B-3. Adding shell commands to nedit

   [neditshellcommand.jpg]

     * Click OK and you'll now be back at the main nedit screen. Load up
       an XML file, and select Shell->Validate DocBook or press Alt-S.
     * The nedit program will fire up and check the contents of the
       window.
     * If all you see is a version number for nsgml then your document
       is valid. Any errors are reported by line number in your
       document.

     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.5. VIM

   [http://www.vim.org] http://www.vim.org

   No mention of text editors is complete without talking about vi. The
   VIM (Vi IMproved) editor has the functionality of regular vi and
   includes "syntax highlighting" of tags.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.5.1. Getting Started

   There are many versions of vi. New authors will likely want one of
   the more feature-packed versions for syntax highlighting and a
   graphical interface including mouse control.

   Red Hat users will want the following packages: vim-common,
   vim-minimal and vim-enhanced. Debian users will want the following
   package: vim. For an X interface (including GUI menus and mouse
   control) users will want gvim. The "g" in gvim is for "Graphical".

   VIM compiles very easy should you need to build your own. Both vim
   and gvim are built by default. Syntax highlighting is included but
   not enabled by default if you have to start from scratch; use the
   :syntax enable command in VIM to turn this feature on.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.5.2. Creating New DocBook XML Files

   In both vim and gvim, .xml files will be recognized and enter into
   "SGML mode". A series of known DocBook tags and attributes have been
   entered into vim and will be highlighted one color if the name is
   known and another if it is not (for this author the colors are yellow
   and blue).

   Having the correct document type declaration at the top of your
   document should add the syntax highlighting. If you do not see this
   highlighting you will need to force VIM into SGML mode (even for XML
   files) using the command :set ft=sgml. If you are working with
   multiple files for a single XML document you can add your document
   type in <-- comments --> to the top of the file to get the correct
   syntax highlighting (you will need to restart the program to see the
   change in highlighting). The top line of this file
   (tools-text-editors.xml) looks like this:

<!-- <!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC '-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN'> -->

     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.5.3. Spell Check

   As in Emacs, Vim, will work quite happily with aspell. It can be run
   from within Vim with the following: :! aspell -c %.

   For more sophisticated spell check alternatives, give
   [http://cream.sourceforge.net/] Cream or
   [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script_search_results.php?keywords=vimspe
   ll&script_type=&order_by=rating&direction=descending&search=search]
   vimspell a try.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.5.4. Tag Completion

   The following information is provided by
   [http://www.digitalhermit.com] Kwan Lowe.

   Vim has a DocBook helper script which can be easily copied into your
   .vimscripts directory and used to "auto complete" tags while writing
   DocBook documents. The script can be downloaded from:
   [http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=38]
   http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=38.

     Grab the file, then untar it. Copy the dbhelper.vim to your
     .vimscripts directory if you have one.

        $ mkdir .vimscripts
        $ cp dbhelper.vim .vimscripts

     You'll also have to convert the dbhelper.vim file to unix
     formatting:

        $ dos2unix dbhelper.vim

     Next, edit your .vimrc file and add the line: source
     /home/yourname/.vimscripts/dbhelper.vim

     To use the scripts, enter vi and go into insert mode. Press ,
     (comma) followed by the shortcut. For example: ,dtbk
     ________________________________________________________________

B.2.2.6. XMLForm

   [http://www.datamech.com/XMLForm/] http://www.datamech.com/XMLForm/

   This web-based application allows you to put in the URL for XML
   source, or copy and paste the XML directly into the web form. The
   application then breaks down your document into a series of form
   fields that hide the DocBook tags so that you may edit the content
   directly. Version 5 is available from

B.2.2.7. XMLmind XML Editor (XXE)

   [http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor] http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor

   David Horton offers the following information:

     I am a big fan of XMLMind's XXE editor and XFC FO converter. It is
     "free as in beer," but not necessarily "free as in speech." Very
     liberal license for personal use however. It's Java-based so it
     works on all sorts of OS's.

B.3. Validation

B.3.1. Why Validate Your Document

   The LDP uses a number of scripts to distribute your document. These
   scripts submit your document to the LDP's CVS (a free document
   version management system), and then they transform your document to
   other formats that users then read. Your document will also be
   mirrored on a number of sites worldwide (yet another set of scripts).

   In order for these scripts to work correctly, your document must be
   both "well formed" and use "valid markup". Well formed means your
   document follows the rules that XML is expecting: it complies with
   XML grammar rules. Valid markup means you only use elements or tags
   which are "valid" for your document: XML vocabulary rules are
   applied.

   If your document is not well formed or uses invalid markup, the
   scripts will not be able to process it. As a result, your revised
   document will not be distributed.

   Note The Docbook Section


   There is more information about how to validate your document in the
   DocBook section. Check out Section B.3 for more help with validating
   your document.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.2. Validation for the Faint of Heart

   Your life is already hard enough without having to install a full set
   of tools just to see if you validate as well. You can upload your raw
   XML files to a web site, then go to [http://validate.sf.net]
   http://validate.sf.net, enter the URL to your document, then validate
   it.

   Note External entities


   When this information was added to the Author Guide external entities
   were not supported. Follow the instructions provided on the Validate
   site if you have trouble.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.3. Validation for the Not So Faint Of Heart
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.3.1. Catalogs

   XML and SGML files contain most of the information you need; however,
   there are sometimes entities which are specific to SGML in general.
   To match these entities to their actual values you need to use a
   catalog. The role of a catalog is to tell your system where to find
   the files it is looking for. You may want to think of a catalog as a
   guide book (or a map) for your tools.

   Most distributions (Red Hat/Fedora and Debian at least) have a common
   location for the main SGML catalog file, called /etc/sgml/catalog. In
   times past, it could also be found in /usr/lib/sgml/catalog.

   The structure of XML catalog files is not the same as SGML catalog
   files. The section on tailoring a catalog (see Section B.3.4) will
   give more details about what these files actually contain.

   If your system cannot find the catalog file, or you are using custom
   catalog files, you may need to set the SGML_CATALOG_FILES and
   XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variables. Using echo
   $SGML_CATALOG_FILES, check to see if it is currently set. If a blank
   line is returned, the variable has not been set. Use the same command
   to see if XML_CATALOG_FILES is set as well. If the variables are not
   set, use the following example to set them now.

   Example B-1. Setting the SGML_CATALOG_FILES and XML_CATALOG_FILES
   Environmental Variables

   bash$ export SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/catalog"

   To make this change permanent, you can add the following lines to
   your ~/.bashrc file.
SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/catalog"
export SGML_CATALOG_FILES

   If you installed XML tools via a RedHat or Debian package, you
   probably don't need to do this step. If you are using a custom XML
   catalog you will definitely need to do this. There is more on custom
   catalogs in the next section. To ensure my backup scripts grab this
   custom file, I have added mine in a sub-directory of my home
   directory named "docbook".

   bash$ export XML_CATALOG_FILES="/home/user/docbook/db-catalog.xml"

   You can also change your .bashrc if you want to save these changes.
XML_CATALOG_FILES="/home/user/docbook/db-catalog.xml"
export XML_CATALOG_FILES

   If you are adding the changes to your .bashrc you will not see the
   changes until you open a new terminal window. To make the changes
   immediate in the current terminal, "source" the configuration file.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.4. Creating and modifying catalogs

   In the previous section I mentioned a catalog is like a guide book
   for your tools. Specifically, a catalog maps the rules from the
   public identifier to your system's files.

   At the top of every DocBook (or indeed every XML) file there is a
   DOCTYPE which tells the processing tool what kind of document it is
   about to be processed. At a minimum this declaration will include a
   public identifier, such as -//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.2//EN. This
   public identifier has a number of sections all separated by //. It
   contains the following information: ISO standard if any (- -- in this
   case there is no ISO standard), author (OASIS), type of document (DTD
   DocBook V4.2), language (English). Your DOCTYPE may also include a
   URL.

   A public identifier is useless to a processing tool, as it needs to
   be able to access the actual DTD. A URL is useless if the processing
   tool is off-line. To help your processor deal with these problems you
   can download all of the necessary files and then "map" them for your
   processing tools by using a catalog.

   If you are using SGML processing tools (for instance Jade), you will
   need an SGML catalog. If you are using XML processing tools (like
   XSLT), you will need an XML catalog. Information on both is included.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.4.1. SGML Catalogs

   Example B-2. Example of an SGML catalog
                                                            (1)
-- Catalog for the Conectiva Styles --

OVERRIDE YES
                                                           (2)
PUBLIC "-//Conectiva SA//DTD DocBook Conectiva variant V1.0//EN"
                        "/home/ldp/styles/books.dtd"

DELEGATE "-//OASIS"
                "/home/ldp/SGML/dtds/catalog.dtd"
                                                           (3)
DOCTYPE BOOK /home/ldp/SGML/dtds/docbook/db31/docbook.dtd

-- EOF --

   (1)
          Comment. Comments start with "--" and follow to the end of the
          line.
   (2)
          The public type association "-//Conectiva SA//DTD books
          V1.0//EN" with the file books.dtd on the directory
          /home/ldp/styles.
   (3)
          Comment signifying the end of the file.

   As in the example above, to associate an identifier to a file just
   follow the sequence shown:

    1. Copy the identifier PUBLIC
    2. Type the identifying text
    3. Indicate the path to the associated file
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.4.1.1. Useful commands for catalogs

   The most common mappings to be used in catalogs are:

   PUBLIC
          The keyword PUBLIC maps public identifiers for identifiers on
          the system.

   SYSTEM
          The SYSTEM keyword maps system identifiers for files on the
          system.

          SYSTEM
          "http://nexus.conectiva/utilidades/publicacoes/livros.dtd"
          "publicacoes/livros.dtd"

   SGMLDECL
          The keyword SGMLDECL designates the system identifier of the
          SGML statement that should be used.

          SGMLDECL "publishings/books.dcl"

   DTDDECL
          Similar to the SGMLDECL the keyword DTDDECL identifies the
          SGML statement that should be used. DTDDECL makes the
          association of the statement with a public identifier to a
          DTD. Unfortunately, this association isn't supported by the
          open source tools available. The benefits of this statement
          can be achieved somehow with multiple catalog files.

          DTDDECL "-//Conectiva SA//DTD livros V1.0//EN"
          "publicacoes/livros.dcl"

   CATALOG
          The keyword CATALOG allows a catalog to be included inside
          another. This is a way to make use of several different
          catalogs without the need to alter them.

   OVERRIDE
          The keyword OVERRIDE informs whether an identifier has
          priority over a system identifier. The standard on most
          systems is that the system identifier has priority over the
          public one.

   DELEGATE
          The keyword DELEGATE allows the association of a catalog to a
          specific type of public identifier. The clause DELEGATE is
          very similar to the CATALOG, except for the fact that it
          doesn't do anything until a specific pattern is specified.

   DOCTYPE
          If a document starts with a type of document, but has no
          public identifier and no system identifier the clause DOCTYPE
          associates this document with a specific DTD.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.4.2. XML Catalogs

   The following sample catalog was provided by Martin A. Brown.

   Example B-3. Sample XML Catalog file
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE catalog PUBLIC "-//OASIS/DTD Entity Resolution XML Catalog V1.0//EN"
          "http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/release/1.0/catalog.dtd
">

<catalog xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:entity:xmlns:xml:catalog">

        <public publicId="-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN"
       uri="/home/mabrown/docbook/dtds/4.2/docbookx.dtd"/>
   <uri name="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd"
       uri="/home/mabrown/docbook/dtds/4.2/docbookx.dtd"/>
   <uri name="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/xhtml/docbook

       uri="/home/mabrown/docbook/xsl/xhtml/chunk.xsl"/>
   <uri name="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/xhtml/profile

       uri="/home/mabrown/docbook/xsl/xhtml/profile-chunk.xsl"/>
</catalog>

B.3.5. Validating XML

B.3.5.1. nsgmls

   You can use nsgmls, which is part of the jade suite (on Debian
   apt-get the docbook-utils package, see Section B.4.2), to validate
   SGML or XML documents.
bash$ nsgmls -s HOWTO.xml

   If there are no issues, you'll just get your command prompt back. The
   -s tells nsgmls to show only the errors.

   Tip Function not found


   If you get errors about a function not being found, or something
   about an ISO character not having an authoritative source, you may
   need to point nsgmls to your xml.dcl file. For Red Hat 9, it will
   look like this: nsgmls -s /usr/share/sgml/xml.dcl HOWTO.xml

   For more information on processing files with Jade/OpenJade please
   read
   [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/DocBook-OpenJade-SGML-XML-HOWTO/index.html
   ] DocBook XML/SGML Processing Using OpenJade.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.5.2. onsgmls

   This is an alternative to nsgmls. It ships with the OpenJade package.
   This program gives more options than nsgmls and allows you to quietly
   ignore a number of problems that arise while trying to validate an
   XML file (as opposed to an SGML file). This also means you don't have
   to type out the location of your xml.dcl file each time.

   I was able to simply use the following to validate a file with only
   error messages that were related to my markup errors.
bash$ onsgmls -s HOWTO.xml

   According to Bob Stayton you can also turn off specific error
   messages. The following example turns off XML-specific error
   messages.
bash$ onsgmls -s -wxml -wno-explicit-sgml-decl HOWTO.xml
     ________________________________________________________________

B.3.5.3. xmllint

   You can also use the xmllint command-line tool from the libxml2
   package to validate your documents. This tool does a simple check on
   completeness of tags and whether all tags that are opened, are also
   closed again. By default xmllint will output a results tree. So if
   your document comes out until the last line, you know there are no
   heavy errors having to do with tag mismatches, opening and closing
   errors and the like.

   To prevent printing the entire document to your screen, add the
   --noout parameter.
bash$ xmllint --noout HOWTO.xml

   If nothing is returned, your document contains no syntax errors.
   Else, start with the first error that was reported. Fix that one
   error, and run the tool again on your document. If it still returns
   output, again fix the first error that you see, don't botter with the
   rest since further errors are usually generated because of the first
   one.

   If you would like to check your document for any errors which are
   specific to your Document Type Definition, add --valid.
bash$ xmllint --noout --valid HOWTO.xml

   The xmllint tool may also be used for checking errors in the XML
   catalogs, see the man pages for more info on how to set this
   behavior.

   If you are a Mac OSX or Windows user, you may also want to check out
   tkxmllint, a GUI version of xmllint. More information is available
   from: [http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/tkxmllint.html]
   http://tclxml.sourceforge.net/tkxmllint.html.

   Example B-4. Debugging example using xmllint

   The example below shows how you can use xmllint to check your
   documents. I've created some errors that I made a lot, as a beginning
   XML writer. At first, the document doesn't come through, and errors
   are shown:
bash$ xmllint ldp-history.xml
ldp-history.xml:22: error: Opening and ending tag mismatch: articlinfo line 6
and articleinfo
</articleinfo>
              ^
ldp-history.xml:37: error: Opening and ending tag mismatch: listitem line 36 a
nd orderedlist
</orderedlist>
              ^
ldp-history.xml:39: error: Opening and ending tag mismatch: orderedlist line 3
4 and sect2
</sect2>
        ^
ldp-history.xml:46: error: Opening and ending tag mismatch: sect1 line 41 and
para
for many authors to contribute their part in their area of specialization.</pa
ra

 ^
ldp-history.xml:57: error: Opening and ending tag mismatch: para line 55 and s
ect1
</sect1>
        ^
ldp-history.xml:59: error: Opening and ending tag mismatch: sect2 line 31 and
article
</article>
          ^
ldp-history.xml:61: error: Premature end of data in tag sect1 line 24

^
ldp-history.xml:61: error: Premature end of data in tag article line 5

^

   Now, as we already mentioned, don't worry about anything except the
   first error. The first error says there is an inconsistency between
   the tags on line 6 and line 22 in the file. Indeed, on line 6 we left
   out the "e" in "articleinfo". Fix the error, and run xmllint again.
   The first complaint now is about the offending line 37, where the
   closing tag for list items has been forgotten. Fix the error and run
   the validation tool again, until all errors are gone. Most common
   errors include forgetting to open or close the paragraph tag,
   spelling errors in tags and messed up sections.

B.4. Transformations

   Warning TLDP will convert your document


   This section is about how to transform documents from DocBook to
   other formats. If you do not need to transform documents for your own
   web site, or to proof read the content, please skip this section.

   If you would like to transform your documents for proofreading
   purposes, please use the XML to HTML on-line converter. You will need
   to upload your XML file(s) to a web site. Then simply drop the URL
   into the form and click the submit button. Your document will be
   magically transformed into a beautiful (and legible) HTML document.
   External files are supported. You may use either absolute or relative
   URIs.

   Another easy-to-use package is xmlto. It is a front-end for xsltproc.
   It is available as a RedHat, Debian (etc) package or can be
   downloaded from [http://cyberelk.net/tim/xmlto/]
   http://cyberelk.net/tim/xmlto/. You can use it to convert documents
   with:
bash$ xmlto html mydoc.xml
bash$ xmlto txt mydoc.xml

   You do not ever need to transform documents before submitting to the
   LDP. The LDP volunteers have a system which transforms your DocBook
   file into HTML, PDF and plain text formats. There, you've been
   warned.

   Still here? Great! Transformations are a pretty basic requirement to
   get what you've written from a messy tag-soup into something that can
   be read. This section will help you get your system set up and ready
   to transform your latest document into other formats. This is very
   useful is you want to see your document before you release it to the
   world.

   There are currently two ways to transform your document: Document
   Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL); and XML Style
   sheets (XSLT). Although the LDP web site uses DSSSL to convert
   documents you may use XSLT if you want. You only need to choose one
   of these methods. For more information about DSSSL read: Section
   B.4.1, for more information about XSLT read: Section B.4.3.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.1. DSSSL

   There are three basic requirements to transform a document using
   DSSSL:

     * The Document Style and Semantics Specification Language files
       (these are plain text files). Section B.4.1.1
     * The Document Type Definition file which matches the DOCTYPE of
       your document (this is a plain text file). Section B.5
     * A processor to do the actual work. Section B.4.1.2
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.1.1. The Style Sheets

   There are two versions of the Document Style Semantics and
   Specification Language used by the LDP to transform documents from
   your raw DocBook files into other formats (which are then published
   on the Web). The LDP version of the style sheets requires the Norman
   Walsh version--which basically means if you're using DSSSL the Norman
   Walsh version can be considered a requirement for system setup.

   Norman Walsh DSSSL [http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/dsssl/]
   http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/dsssl/. The Document Style
   Semantics and Specification Language tells Jade (see Section B.4.1.2)
   how to render a DocBook document into print or on-line form. The
   DSSSL is what converts a title tag into an <h1> HTML tag, or to 14
   point bold Times Roman for RTF, for example. Documentation for DSSSL
   is located at the same site. Note that modifying the DSSSL doesn't
   modify DocBook itself. It merely changes the way the rendered text
   looks. The LDP uses a modified DSSSL (see below).

   LDP DSSSL [http://www.tldp.org/authors/tools/ldp.dsl]
   http://www.tldp.org/authors/tools/ldp.dsl. The LDP DSSSL requires the
   Norman Walsh version (see above) but is a slightly modified DSSSL to
   provide things like a table of contents.

   Example B-5. "Installing" DSSSL style sheets

   Create a base directory to store everything such as /usr/share/sgml/.
   Copy the DSSSL style sheets into a sub-directory named dsssl.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.1.2. DSSSL Processors

   There are two versions of the Jade processor: the original version by
   James Clark; and an open-source version of approximately the same
   program, OpenJade. You only need one of these programs. It should be
   installed after the DTD and DSSSL have been "installed."

   DSSSL Transformation Tools

   Jade
          [ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/jade/]
          ftp://ftp.jclark.com/pub/jade/

          Currently, the latest version of the package is
          jade-1.2.1.tar.gz.

          Jade is the front-end processor for SGML and XML. It uses the
          DSSSL and DocBook DTD to perform the verification and
          rendering from SGML and XML into the target format.

   OpenJade
          [http://openjade.sourceforge.net/]
          http://openjade.sourceforge.net/

          An extension of Jade written by the DSSSL community. Some
          applications require jade, but are being updated to support
          either software package.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.1.3. System Setup for DSSSL Transformations

    1. Tell your system where to find the SGML_CATALOG_FILES (yes, even
       if you are using XML). You can find an example of how to do this
       in Example B-1.
    2. Download the DSSSL and DTD files and copy them into your working
       directory. You can find an example of how to do this in Example
       B-5 and Example B-7.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.1.4. Transformations with DSSSL

   Once your system is configured (see the previous section), you should
   be able to start using jade to transform your files from XML to
   XHTML.

   To create individual HTML files, point jade at the correct DSL (style
   sheet). The following example uses the LDP style sheet.
bash$ jade -t xml -i html \
        -d /usr/local/sgml/dsssl/docbook/html/ldp.dsl#html \
        HOWTO.xml

   If you would like to produce a single-file HTML page, add the -V
   nochunks parameter. You can specify the name of the final HTML file
   by appending the command with > output.html.
bash$ jade -t xml -i html -V nochunks \
        -d /usr/local/sgml/dsssl/stylesheets/ldp.dsl#html \
        HOWTO.sgml > output.html

   Note Not a function name errors


   If you get an error about "is not a function name", you will need to
   add a pointer to xml.dcl. It has to be listed immediately before the
   pointer to your XML document. Try one of the following locations:
   /usr/lib/sgml/declaration/xml.dcl, or
   /usr/share/sgml/declaration/xml.dcl. Use locate to find the file if
   it is not in either of those two places. The modified command would
   be as follows:
bash$ jade -t xml -i html \
        -d /usr/local/sgml/dsssl/docbook/html/ldp.dsl#html \
        /usr/lib/sgml/declaration/xml.dcl HOWTO.xml

   If you would like to create print-friendly files instead of HTML
   files, simply change the style sheet that you are using. In the file
   name above, note "html/ldp.dsl" at the end. Change this to
   "print/docbook.dsl", or if you want XHTML output, instead of HTML,
   change the file name to "xhtml/docbook.dsl".
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.1.4.1. Changing CSS Files

   If you want your HTML files to use a specific CSS stylesheet, you
   will need to edit ldp.dsl. Immediately after ;; End of
   $verbatim-display$ redefinition add the following lines:
(define %stylesheet-type%
  ;; The type of the stylesheet to use
  "text/css")

(define %stylesheet%
  ;; Name of the css stylesheet to use, use value #f if you don't want to
  ;; use css stylesheets
  "base.css")

   Replace base.css with the name of the CSS file you would like to use.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.2. The docbook-utils Package

   The docbook-utils provide commands like db2html, db2pdf and db2ps,
   based on the jw scripts, that is a front-end to Jade. These tools
   ease the everyday management of documentation and add comfortable
   features.

   The package, originally created by RedHat and available from
   [http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/]
   http://sources.redhat.com/docbook-tools/ can be installed on most
   systems.

   Example B-6. Example creating HTML output

   After validating your document, simply issue the command db2html
   mydoc.xml to create (a) HTML file(s). You can also use the
   docbook-utils as validation tools. Remember: when errors occur,
   always start by solving only the first problem. The rest of the
   problems may be fixed when you fix the first error.

   If you get errors about a function name, please read .
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.2.1. Using CSS and DSL for pretty output

   You can define your own additional DSL instructions, which can
   include a pointer to a personalized CSS file. Sample DSL and CSS
   files are provided in Appendix A.

   The sample DSL file will create a table of contents, and have all
   HTML files start with the prefix intro2linux- and end with a suffix
   of .html. The %stylesheet% variable points to the CSS file which
   should be called by your HTML file.

   To use a specific DSL style sheet the following command should be
   used:

B.4.3. XSL

   There are alternatives to DSSSL and Jade/OpenJade.

   When working with DocBook XML, the LDP offers a series of XSL[2]
   style sheets to process documents into HTML. These style sheets
   create output files using the XML tool set that are similar to those
   produced by the SGML tools using ldp.dsl.

   The major difference between using ldp.dsl and the XSL style sheets
   is the way that the generation of multiple files is handled, such as
   the creation of a separate file for each chapter, section and
   appendix. With the SGML tools, such as jade or openjade, the tool
   itself was responsible for generating the separate files. Because of
   this, only a single file, ldp.dsl was necessary as a customization
   layer for the standard DocBook DSSSL style sheets.

   With the DocBook XSL style sheets, generation of multiple files is
   controlled by the style sheet. If you want to generate a single file,
   you call one style sheet. If you want to generate multiple files, you
   call a different style sheet. For that reason the LDP XSL style sheet
   distribution is comprised of four files:

    1. tldp-html.xsl - style sheet called to generate a single file.
    2. tldp-html-chunk.xsl[3] - style sheet called to generate multiple
       files based on chapter, section and appendix elements.
    3. tldp-html-common.xsl - style sheet containing the actual XSLT
       transformations. It is called by the other two HTML style sheets
       and is never directly called.
    4. tldp-print.xsl - style sheet for generation of XSL Formatting
       Objects for print output.

   You can find the latest copy of the files at
   [http://my.core.com/~dhorton/docbook/tldp-xsl/]
   http://my.core.com/~dhorton/docbook/tldp-xsl/. The package includes
   installation instructions which are duplicated at
   [http://my.core.com/~dhorton/docbook/tldp-xsl/doc/tldp-xsl-howto.html
   ]
   http://my.core.com/~dhorton/docbook/tldp-xsl/doc/tldp-xsl-howto.html.
   The short version of the install instructions is as follows: Download
   and unzip the latest package from the web site. Take the files from
   the html directory of TLDP-XSL and put them in the html directory of
   Norman Walsh's stylesheets. Take the file from the TLDP-XSL fo
   directory and put it in the Norman Walsh fo directory.

   Once you have installed these files you can use xsltproc to generate
   HTML files from your XML documents. To transform your XML file(s)
   into a single-page HTML document use the following command:
bash$  xsltproc -o HOWTO.html /usr/local/sgml/stylesheets/tldp-html.xsl HOWTO.
xml

   To generate a set of linked HTML pages, with a separate page for each
   chapter, sect1 or appendix, use the following command:
bash$ xsltproc /usr/share/sgml/stylesheets/tldp-html-chunk.xsl HOWTO.xml

   Note that you never directly call the style sheet
   tldp-html-common.xsl. It is called by both of the other two style
   sheets.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.4.3.1. Changing CSS Files

   If you want your HTML files to use a specific CSS stylesheet, you
   will need to edit tldp-html-common.xsl. Look for a line that
   ressembles <xsl:param name="html.stylesheet" select="'style.css'"/>.

   Replace style.css with the name of the CSS file you would like to
   use.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.5. DocBook DTD

   The DocBook DTD defines the structure of a DocBook document. It
   contains rules about how the elements may be used; and what the
   elements ought to be describing. For example: it is the DocBook DTD
   which states all warnings are to warn the reader (this is the
   definition of the element); and may not contain plain text (this is
   the content model--and the bit which forces you to wrap your warning
   text in a para or perhaps a list).

   Caution Versions


   It is important that you download the version(s) that match your
   document. You may want to configure your system now to deal with
   "all" DocBook DTDs if you are going to be editing older LDP
   documents. If you are a new author, you only need the first one
   listed: XML DTD for DocBook version 4.2.

   The XML DTD is available from
   [http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2]
   http://www.oasis-open.org/xml/4.2/. The LDP prefers this version of
   the DocBook DTD.

   If you are going to be working with SGML versions of DocBook you will
   need one (or both) of:
   [http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/4.1/docbk41.zip]
   http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/4.1/docbk41.zip or
   [http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/3.1/docbk31.zip]
   http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/sgml/3.1/docbk31.zip

   Example B-7. "Installing" DocBook Document Type Definitions

   Create a base directory to store everything such as /opt/local/sgml/.
   Copy the DTDs into a sub-directory named dtd.

   Warning Do not edit DTD files


   The DocBook standard is described in these files. If you change these
   files, you are no longer working with DocBook.
     ________________________________________________________________

B.6. Formatting Documents

B.6.1. Inserting a summary on the initial articles page

   A feature that might be valuable in some cases is the insertion of
   the summary on the initial page of an article. DocBook articles do
   not include it as a standard feature.

   To enable this, it is necessary to modify the style sheet file.

   Example B-8. Style sheet to insert summaries in articles
<!DOCTYPE style-sheet PUBLIC "-//James Clark//DTD DSSSL Style Sheet//EN" [
<!entity html-docbook PUBLIC "-//Norman Walsh//DOCUMENT DocBook HTML Styleshee
t//EN" CDATA DSSSL>
<!entity print-docbook PUBLIC "-//Norman Walsh//DOCUMENT DocBook Print Stylesh
eet//EN" CDATA DSSSL>
]>

<style-sheet>
<style-specification use="html">
<style-specification-body>

; Includes a summary at the beginning of an item.
(define %generate-article-toc% #t)

</style-specification-body>
</style-specification>
<style-specification use="print">
<style-specification-body>

; Includes a summary at the beginning of an item.
(define %generate-article-toc% #t)

</style-specification-body>
</style-specification>
<external-specification id="html" document="html-docbook">
<external-specification id="print" document="print-docbook">
</style-sheet>

     ________________________________________________________________

B.6.2. Inserting indexes automatically

   Although DocBook has markups for the composition of them, indexes are
   not generated automatically. The collateindex.pl command allows
   indexes to be generated from the source DocBook for inclusion into
   the finished/transformed document.

    1. Process the document with jade using the style to HTML with the
       option -V html-index.

bash$ jade -t sgml \
        -d html/docbook.dsl -V html-index document.sgml

    2. Generate the index.sgml file with collateindex.pl.

bash$  perl collateindex.pl \
        -o index.sgml HTML.index

   For the above example to work, it is necessary to define an external
   entity by calling the file index.sgml.

   Example B-9. Configuring an external entity to include the index
<!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD
DocBook V3.1//EN" [

<!-- Insertion of the index --> <!entity index SYSTEM
"index.sgml"> ]>

   See also Section D.4 for information on how to insert necessary
   information on the text.

   Note Odd behavior generating indexes for print versions


   Remember that if you're trying to get Tables of Contents or Indexes
   on PS or PDF output you'll need to run jadetex or pdfjadetex at least
   three times. This is required by TeX but not by DocBook or related
   applications.
     ________________________________________________________________

Appendix C. Concurrent Version System (CVS)

   The LDP provides optional CVS access to its authors. This enables
   collaborative writing and has the following positive effects:

    1. CVS will keep an off-site backup of your documents. In the event
       that you hand over a document to another author, they can just
       retrieve the document from CVS and continue on. In the event you
       need to go back to a previous version of a document, you can
       retrieve it as well.
    2. However difficult from an organizational point of view, it's
       great to have multiple people working on the same document. CVS
       enables you to do this. You can have CVS tell you what changes
       were made by another author while you were editing your copy, and
       integrate those changes.
    3. CVS keeps a log of what changes were made. These logs (and a date
       stamp) can be placed automatically inside your documents when
       they are published.
    4. CVS can be combined with scripts to automatically update the LDP
       web site with new documentation as it's written and submitted.
       This is not in place yet, but it is a goal. Currently, CVS
       updates signal the HOWTO coordinator to update the LDP web page,
       meaning that if you use CVS, you're not required to e-mail your
       XML code. (Although you do still need to send the submit list an
       email when you are ready for your document to be published,
       because the whole publishing process has not been fully automated
       yet.)

   Note Access to our CVS repository


   Only authors with at least three submissions get access to our CVS,
   see Appendix C.

   You can browse the LDP CVS repository via the web at
   [http://cvs.tldp.org/] http://cvs.tldp.org/.
     ________________________________________________________________

C.1. Getting a CVS account

   Caution CVS accounts will not be granted to all applicants


   To be granted a CVS account you must qualify under one of the
   following categories:

     * authors with documents already in the collection who have made a
       minimum of three submits to the LDP through <submit@en.tldp.org>
     * technical and language reviewers approved by one of the Review
       Coordinators
     * new authors in the review process (also requires approval from
       one of the Review Coordinators)

   Please do not apply for a CVS account if you do not qualify.

   If you qualify for a CVS account you may apply for one contacting CVS
   master Sergiusz [mailto:ser@gnu.org] mailto:ser@gnu.org Include
   information about which documents you maintain.
     ________________________________________________________________

C.2. Using CVS

C.2.1. Setting Up Your CVS Account

   First you'll need to get an account at the LDP's CVS Repository.
   Please see the notes above on obtaining an account. This repository
   houses various documents including HOWTOs and Guides. Documents are
   sorted by the type of document (for example a HOWTO or a Guide), and
   by the markup language the document uses (for example DocBook or
   LinuxDoc).

   When your account is ready you can log in using one of the following
   commands. In all instances your_userid should be replaced by the user
   name you were issued in the response email. You will be prompted for
   a password after this first step.

   Initializing Your CVS Account

   Linux system
          cvs -d :pserver:your_userid@cvs.tldp.org:/cvsroot login

   Windows system
          set CVSROOT=":pserver:your_userid@cvs.tldp.org:/cvsroot"

          cvs -d %CVSROOT% login

   Wait patiently while the system tries to log you in. It can often
   take more that 10-20 seconds for the system to either accept (or
   reject) your password. Once you've used cvs login for the first time
   and have been given access to the system, your password is stored in
   .cvspass and you will not have to use cvs login again. Just set the
   CVSROOT with the export command listed above and continue on. If
   TLDP's CVS server is the only one you work with, you might also add
   an export CVSROOT line to your ~/.bashrc shell configuration file.
     ________________________________________________________________

C.2.2. Getting the Documents

   You can get the entire repository (about 150 MB) with: cvs checkout
   LDP

   Or you can get the source for your own document with: cvs checkout
   LDP/howto/docbook/YOUR-HOWTO.xml OR cvs checkout
   LDP/guide/docbook/YOURGUIDE

   Windows users will need to use a modified version of this command.
   Instead they should use: cvs -d %CVSROOT% checkout
   LDP/howto/docbook/YOUR-HOWTO.xml

   Note Keep an overview


   checkout will add the full directory structure from tldp.org on down.
   Although it doesn't really matter where you put these files on your
   local file system you may not want to bury the directories too
   deeply.
     ________________________________________________________________

C.2.3. CVS Commands

   CVS Commands: a brief reminder

   commit
          This CVS command will upload your changes to the CVS server.

          Please be sure to include a useful description of the changes
          that have been made to your document.

          If you want to bypass the editor screen you can use

          cvs commit -m "A description of the work done on this version
          of the document."

          Note Ready for publication warning


   You must still email <submit@en.tldp.org> when you are ready to have
   your changes appear on the live site. Your email should include the
   relative path to the file(s) in the LDP CVS tree that you wish to
   update.

   add
          You can add new files to your CVS repository. These may be
          image files or additional XML files. First check that your
          HOWTO is in its own directory. You may want to coordinate with
          the people at <submit@en.tldp.org> to ensure you can add
          graphics or other files to your HOWTO.

          Copy the files you want to add into your local CVS repository
          (where all of your downloaded/working files are). Then:

          cvs add filename

          After you've added the files, you still need to commit them to
          the repository (see above).

   remove

   $Id: cvs.xml,v 1.32 2011/01/14 16:24:52 serek Exp $
          While this is not a CVS "command" it can be used to
          automatically insert information about the file including the
          time and date it was last modified, the version number it was
          assigned by the CVS and the filename of this particular file.
          The output will look like this: $Id: cvs.xml,v 1.9 2002/04/21
          09:44:26 serek Exp $

   If you need to change a file name, you still need to use the add
   command. First remove the copy of the file from your local disk. Then
   remove it from the CVS tree with: cvs remove filename. As with the
   add command, you need to >commit your removed file. Finally, now that
   the old file has been removed, add your new file using the
   instructions above (first add and then commit the additional file).
     ________________________________________________________________

C.2.3.1. Recovering old versions

   There you are, typing away, when you screw up. Real bad. Doesn't
   matter what it is, but suffice it to say that you've toasted not only
   the version on your local drive, but created a new version on the CVS
   server. What you need to do is go back in time and resurrect an older
   version of your file.

   To do this, you'll need to know the version number of the file you
   want to retrieve. cvs diff will give a list of revisions if there are
   differences. You can pick the revision number, subtract one, and that
   is probably the revision you want to look at.

   The command

   cvs -Q update -p -r revision filename

   will output to stdout the contents of the revision version of
   filename. You can pipe it to more or redirect the output to a file.
   Conveniently, you can redirect stdout to a file called filename. Your
   local file is now the revision you want, and

   cvs update

   will update the CVS server with the new (old) version of filename.
     ________________________________________________________________

C.3. CVS Resources

   If you're completely new to CVS, there are a few web pages you may
   want to look at which can help you out:

Appendix D. DocBook: Sample Markup

D.1. General Tips and Tricks

   For a general overview of what markup is all about, please read
   Chapter 5

     * An editor capable of inserting elements according to the DTD will
       help a lot since it will enforce the DTD. This way you can be
       sure that no invalid elements were added anywhere in your
       document.
     * In order to ensure that future changes are as easy as possible,
       authors should try to keep compatibility with the XML version of
       the DocBook DTD. This means keeping element names in lower case,
       using double quotes in all attributes, and not omitting end tags.
       Most tools that automatically insert elements (like psgml+emacs)
       follow these rules automatically or with some fine tuning.
     * Each type of document created has a specific structure. This
       document is in "book" format. Most authors, however, will want to
       use the shorter "article" format instead. Templates are available
       from Appendix A.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.1.1. Useful markup

   Table D-1 shows some markup that is useful for generating generic
   documents. Remember that some elements are valid only on some
   contexts.

   Tip Check several formats


   Sometimes the appearance of a particular tag changes from one
   conversion format to another. As a beginner in DocBook writing, you
   may wish to see how your document looks in several formats before you
   publish them. You are advised to look at how your document is
   presented in HTML, PDF and PostScript, since these formats will be
   made available by TLDP once you publish your document.

   Note Better too much than not enough


   Since the formatting depends on the output style chosen, it's
   recommended to use as much markup as possible. Even if the appearance
   of the output doesn't seem to change with the standard output style,
   there may be specific output formats that will make these tags stand
   out.

   Notes:
   a. Text can be emphasized in a few ways. The most common ways are
   italics and bold. DocBook, however, supports only italics. The use of
   bold requires additional settings on the style sheet used.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.2. <section> and <sectN>: what's the difference?

   Note Acknowledgment


   These notes were provided by: [http://geekhavoc.com] John Daily and
   Saqib Ali (<saqib@seagate.com>).

   <section> versus <sectN> is largely a question of flexibility. The
   stylesheets can make a <section> in a <section> look just like a
   <sect2> within a <sect1>, so there's no output advantage.

   But, a <section> within a <section> can be extracted into its own
   top-level section, nested even more deeply, or moved to an entirely
   different part of the document, without it and its own <section>
   children being renamed. That is not true of the numbered section
   tags, which are very sensitive to rearrangements. This can be easier
   for authors who are new to DocBook than using <sectN>.

   The main idea behind creating structured data is that it should be
   easy to access and query. One should be able to retrieve a subsection
   of any structured data, by using querying languages for XML (XPath
   and XQuery). <sectN> are useful when traversing a document using
   XPath/XQuery. <sectN> gives more flexibility, and control while
   writing an XPath expression.

   A well-defined, valid and well-structured document makes it easier
   for one to write XPath/Query to retreive "specific" data from a
   document. For example you can use XPath to retrieve information in
   the <sect3> block with certain attributes. However if you just used
   <section> for all subsections, it becomes harder to retrieve the
   block of information that you need.

   So which one should you use? The one you feel most comfortable with
   is a good place to start. This document is written with <section>s.
   You may, or may not, think this is a good idea. :)
     ________________________________________________________________

D.3. Command Prompts

   There are likely as many ways of doing this as there are DocBook
   authors; however, here are two ways that you might find useful.
   Thanks to [http://www.appaji.net/] Y Giridhar Appaji Nag and
   [http://linux-ip.net/] Martin Brown for the markup used here.

   Example D-1. Command Prompt with programlisting
<programlisting>
        <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>cd</command> /some/dir</userinp
ut>
        <prompt># </prompt><userinput><command>ls</command> -l</userinput>
</programlisting>

   Displays as:
# cd /some/dir
# ls -l

   Example D-2. Command Prompt with screen

   First create a general entity in the internal subset at the very
   beginning of your document. This entity will define a name for the
   shortcut which you can use to display the full prompt at any point in
   your document. <!ENTITY prompt "<prompt>[user@machine
   ~/dir]$</prompt>">

   For more information about entities, read Section D.8.
<screen>
&prompt; <userinput>cd /some/dir</userinput>
&prompt; <userinput>ls -l</userinput> </screen>

   Displays as:

[user@machine ~/dir]$ cd /some/dir
[user@machine ~/dir]$ ls -l

   If you would like to add the output of your commands you can add
   <computeroutput> text</computeroutput> within the <screen> or
   <programlisting> as appropriate.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.4. Encoding Indexes

   The generation of indexes depends on the markups inserted in the
   text.

   Such markups will be processed afterwards by an external tool and
   will generate the index. An example of such a tool is the
   collateindex.pl script (see Section B.6.2). Details about the process
   used to generate these indexes are shown in Section B.6.2.

   The indexes have nesting levels. The markup of an index is done by
   the code Example D-3.

   Example D-3. Code for the generation of an index
<indexterm>
   <primary>Main level</primary>
   <secondary>Second level</secondary>
        <tertiary>Third level</tertiary>
        </indexterm>

   It is possible to refer to chapters, sections, and other parts of the
   document using the attribute zone.

   Example D-4. Use of the attribute zone
<section id="encoding-index">
<title>Encoding Indexes</title>
<indexterm zone="encoding-index">
<primary>edition</primary> <secondary>index</secondary>
</indexterm>

<para>
        The generation of indexes depend on the inserted markups on the text.
</para>

   The Example D-4 has the code used to generate the entry of this
   edition on the index. In fact, since the attribute zone is used, the
   index statement could be located anywhere in the document or even in
   a separate file.

   However, to facilitate maintenance the entries for the index were all
   placed after the text to which it refers.

   Example D-5. Usage of values startofrange and endofrange on the
   attributeclass
    <para>Typing the text normally
    sometimes there's the need of
   <indexterm class="startofrange"
   id="example-band-index">
      <primary>examples</primary> <secondary>index</secondary>
   </indexterm> mark large amounts of
   text.</para>

   <para>Keep inserting the paragraphs
   normally.</para>

   <para>Until the end of the section
   intended to be indexed.  <indexterm
   startref="example-band-index" class="endofrange">.
   </para>
     ________________________________________________________________

D.5. Inserting Pictures

   It is necessary to insert pictures formats for all possible finished
   document types. For example: JPG files for web pages and EPS for
   PostScript and PDF files.

   If you use the TeX format you'll need the images as a PostScript
   file. For on-line publishing you can use any kind of common image
   file, such as JPG, GIF or PNG.

   The easiest way to insert pictures is to use the fileref attribute.
   Usually pictures are generated in JPG and in PostScript (PS or EPS).

   Example D-6. Inserting a picture
<figure>
   <title>Picture's
   Title</title> <graphic fileref="images/file"></graphic>
</figure>

   Replacing <figure> by <informalfigure> eliminates the need to insert
   a title for the picture.

   There's still the float attribute on which the value 0 indicates that
   the picture should be placed exactly where the tag appears. The value
   1 allows the picture to be moved to a more convenient location (this
   location can be described on the style sheet, or it can be controlled
   by the application).
     ________________________________________________________________

D.5.1. Graphics formats

   When submitting graphics to the LDP, please submit one set of
   graphics in .eps, and another in .gif, .jpg or .png. The preferred
   format is .png or .jpg due to patent problems with .gif.

   You can use .jpg files for continuous-tone images such as photos or
   images with gradual changes in color. Use .png for simple images like
   diagrams, some screen shots, and images with a low number of colors.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.5.2. Alternative Methods

   The first alternative to Example D-6 is to eliminate the <figure> or
   <informalfigure> elements.

   Another interesting alternative when you have decided to publish the
   text on media where pictures are not accepted, is the use of a
   wrapper, <imageobject>.

   Example D-7. Using <imageobject>
<figure>
   <title>Title</title>
   <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
         <imagedata fileref="images/file.eps" format="EPS">
      </imageobject>
   <imageobject>
         <imagedata fileref="images/file.jpg" format="JPG">
      </imageobject>
      <textobject>
         <phrase>Here there's an image of this example</phrase>
      </textobject>
   <caption>
   <para>Image Description. Optional. </para>
   </caption>
   </mediaobject>
</figure>

   Files using the following formats are available BMP, CGM-BINARY,
   CGM-CHAR, CGM-CLEAR, DITROFF, DVI, EPS, EQN, FAX, GIF, GIF87A,
   GIF89A, IGES, JPEG, JPG, LINESPECIFIC, PCX, PIC, PS, SGML, TBL, TEX,
   TIFF, WMF, WPG.

   This method presents an advantage: a better control of the
   application. The elements <imageobject> are consecutively tested
   until one of them is accepted. If the output format does not support
   images the <textobject> element will be used. However, the biggest
   advantage in usage of the format Example D-7 is that in DocBook 5.0,
   the <graphic> element will cease to exist.

   As a disadvantage, there is the need for more than one representation
   code of the same information. It is up to the author to decide how
   they will implement illustrations and pictures in the document, but
   for compatibility with future versions I recommend the use of this
   method for pictures and graphics.

   Warning Title page exception


   <mediaobject>s will not display if they are used on a title page. For
   more information read:
   [http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HtmlCustomEx.html#HTMLTitlePage]
   http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HtmlCustomEx.html#HTMLTitlePage

   Note ASCII Images


   You may also want to try converting your image to an ASCII
   representation of the file. JavE (Java ASCII Versatile Editor) can do
   this conversion for you. It can be downloaded from
   [http://www.jave.de/] http://www.jave.de/. It has an easy to use GUI
   interface.

   If you're more command-line oriented you may want to try: tgif

   http://bourbon.usc.edu:8001/tgif/) and AA-Lib

D.6. Markup for Metadata

D.6.1. Crediting Translators, Converters and Co-authors

   There are several ways that these folks, as well as other
   contributors to your document, can be given some recognition for the
   help they've given you.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.6.1.1. <othercredit>

   All translators, converters and co-authors should be credited with an
   <othercredit> tag entry. To properly credit a translator or
   converter, use the <othercredit> tag with the role attribute set to
   "converter" or "translator", as indicated in the example below:

   Example D-8. Other Credit
<othercredit role='converter'>
  <firstname>David</firstname>
  <surname>Merrill</surname>
  <contrib>Conversion from HTML to DocBook v3.1 (SGML).</contrib>
</othercredit>
     ________________________________________________________________

D.6.1.2. Crediting Editors and Reviewers

   To help track the review process all new documents must include a
   reference to the reviewers for the
   [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/techreview.html]
   technical,
   [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/languagereview.html]
   language and
   [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LDP-Reviewer-HOWTO/metadatareview.html]
   metadata reviews.

   Example D-9. Editor
<editor>
  <firstname>Tabatha</firstname>
  <surname>Marshall</surname>
  <contrib>Language review of version 0.8</contrib>
</editor>
     ________________________________________________________________

D.6.2. <revremark>s

   Within the <revision> tag hierarchy is a tag called <revremark>.
   Within this tag, you can make any brief notes you wish about each
   particular revision of your document.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.6.3. Revision History

   The <revhistory> tag should be used to denote the various revisions
   of the document. Specify the date, revision number and comments
   regarding what has changed.

   Revisions should be listed with the most-recent version at the top
   (list in descending order).
     ________________________________________________________________

D.6.4. Date formats

   The <pubdate> tag in your header should list the publication date of
   this particular version of the document (coincide with the revision
   date). It should be in the following format:
   <pubdate>2002-04-25</pubdate>

   The date is in the format YYYY-MM-DD, which is one of the
   [http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime] ISO 8601 standard formats for
   representing dates. For you Yanks out there (me too), think of it as
   going from the largest unit of time to the smallest.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.6.5. Sample Article (or Book) Information Element

   Here is a sample of a complete DocBook (SGML or XML) <articleinfo>
   element which contains some of the items and constructs previously
   described.

   Example D-10. Sample Meta Data
<!--
   Above these lines in a typical DocBook article would be the article
   element (the immediate parent of the articleinfo element) and above
   that typically, the DOCTYPE declaration and internal subset.
  -->

<articleinfo>

  <!--
        Use "HOWTO", "mini HOWTO", "FAQ" in title, if appropriate
  -->

<title>Sample HOWTO</title>

                </revision>
        </revhistory>

   <!--
                Provide a good abstract; a couple of sentences is sufficient
   -->

  <abstract>
                <para>
       This is a sample DocBook (SGML or XML) HOWTO which has been
       constructed to serve as a template.
                </para>
        </abstract>

</articleinfo>
     ________________________________________________________________

D.7. Bibliographies

   Not everyone will choose to use the correct formatting for a
   bibliography. Most will use a list of some kind. And that's ok. But
   when you're ready to move to the next level, here's how to do it.

   Below are two examples of bibliographic entries. The first is a very
   simple entry. It has only a title, URL and possibly a short
   description (abstract). The second is a little more complex and is
   for a full entry (for instance a book) with an ISBN, publisher and
   copyright date.

   Note DocBook requirements for bibliographic references


   At least one element within <biblioentry> is required, but it doesn't
   matter which one you have. So you might have a <title>, or a URL
   (<bibliosource>), or an <author>, or, ...

   For a full list of all options, visit
   [http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/biblioentry.html]
   http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/biblioentry.html. For more examples
   visit [http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/bibliography.html]
   http://docbook.org/tdg/en/html/bibliography.html.

   Caution Displaying <abstract> content


   By default <abstract>s do not display on web pages. You need to
   modify the biblio.xsl file. Do a search for the word "abstract" and
   then add this information inside the <xsl:template> tags. If that
   doesn't make sense, don't worry about it too much, but do be aware
   that it's required for the abstracts to show up.
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="{name(.)}">
    <xsl:apply-templates mode="bibliography.mode"/>
</div>

   Example D-11. A Bibliography
<bibliography>
<title>Bibliography title</title>

<bibliodiv>
<title>Section title</title>
<biblioentry>
<title>Book or Web Site Title</title>
<bibliosource><ulink url=""/></bibliosource>
<abstract></abstract>
</biblioentry>

<biblioentry>
<title></title>
<bibliosource><ulink url=""/></bibliosource>

D.8. Entities (shortcuts, text macros and re-usable text)

   There may be some segments of text, or markup that you want to use
   over and over again. Instead of typing it up multiple times (and then
   having to edit it multiple times if you want to make a change) you
   can use external entities. Entities can give you a short cut to:
   re-using whole documents, text snippets, and special markup. Some
   common ways to use an entity would be for:

     * text macros for markup. An example would be a company URL. By
       using a parameter entity you could refer simply to
       &my-company-url; instead of typing out the full <ulink
       url="http://foo.bar">Foo.bar</ulink> each time.
     * software license. Such as the GNU Free Documentation License: it
       is long. And must be included in full in each document. By
       leaving the license in a separate file you can easily include it
       in many documents without having to redo the markup each time.
     * repeated text. For instance an introduction to a topic which is
       included both as a summary in one section and as an introduction
       to the full information in another. Saves on editing time if you
       need to make changes to both sets of text.

   Example D-12. Adding Entities
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN"
"http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd" [
<-- I can add comments here -->
<!ENTITY shortcut "Replace 'shortcut' with this text.">

<!ENTITY sc-to-a-file SYSTEM "anotherfile.xml">
<-- note: the square bracket on the third line is closed on the next
line--> ]>

   To use these entities simply insert the name you gave the entity
   between a "&" (ampersand) and a ";" (semicolon). For example:
   "&shortcut;" would expand into "Replace 'shortcut' with this text";
   "&sc-to-a-file;" would include the full contents of whatever is in
   anotherfile.xml.

   An important feature while writing a text is the ability to check
   whether or not it will be presented in the final draft. It is common
   to have several parts of the text marked as draft, especially when
   updating an already existing document.

   With the use of parameter entities, you can include or eliminate
   these drafts by altering only one line at the beginning of a
   document.

   Example D-13. Use of parameter entities
<!ENTITY % review "INCLUDE"> ...
<![%review;[ <para>This paragraph will
be included on the draft when the entity "review" is defined with the
value "INCLUDE". </para> ]]>

   The entity review might have several texts defined, as in Example
   D-13. When the changes to the text are considered final, you need
   only to remove parts of the text between the 3^rd. and 6^th. lines.

   To keep the draft definitions and hide the text in the final draft,
   just alter the specification of the entity from INCLUDE to IGNORE.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.9. Customizing your HTML files

D.9.1. HTML file names

   By default, when separate HTML files are made, the SGML processor
   will assign arbitrary names to the resulting files. This can be
   confusing to readers who may bookmark a page only to have it change.
   Whatever your reasoning, here's how to make separate files named the
   way you want:

   In your first <article> tag (which should be the only one) include an
   id parameter and call it "index". This will make your tag look like
   this:
   <article id="index">

   Do not modify the first <chapter> tag, as it's usually an
   introduction and you want that on the first page. For each other
   <section> tag, include the id parameter and name it. A name should
   include only alphanumeric characters, and it should be short enough
   to understand what it is.

        <chapter id="tips">

   Note Pick section IDs intelligently


   We all know that Cool URIs Don't Change. This means your ids should
   not change either. Unless of course the content for the id has
   changed substantially and the id name is no longer relevant.

   Warning HTML file name generation using Jade


   If you are using Jade to transform your DocBook into HTML you must
   use the following parameter: -V %use-id-as-filename%.
     ________________________________________________________________

D.9.2. Headers and Footers

   There is no "easy" way to add headers and footers to your document.
   If you are using DocBook XSL and doing your own document
   transformations you may customize the XSL template to suit your
   needs. For more information read
   [http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HTMLHeaders.html]
   http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/HTMLHeaders.html.

Appendix E. Converting Documents to DocBook XML

   A variety of free and commercial tools exist for doing "up
   conversion" of non-XML formats to DocBook. A few are listed here for
   your convenience. A more comprehensive list is available from
   [http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/ConvertOtherFormatsToDocBook] Convert
   Other Formats to DocBook.
     ________________________________________________________________

E.1. Text to DocBook

   The txt2docbook tool allows one to convert a ascii (README-like) file
   to a valid docbook xml document. It simplifies the publishing of
   rather small papers significantly. The input format was inspired by
   the APT-Convert tool from [http://www.xmlmind.com/aptconvert.html]
   http://www.xmlmind.com/aptconvert.html.

   The script can be downloaded from
   [http://txt2docbook.sourceforge.net/]
   http://txt2docbook.sourceforge.net/.
     ________________________________________________________________

E.2. OpenOffice.org to DocBook

   As of [http://www.openoffice.org] OpenOffice.org (OOo) 1.1RC there
   has been support for exporting files to DocBook format.

   Although OOo uses the full DocBook document type declaration, it does
   not actually export the full list of DocBook elements. It uses a
   "simplified" DocBook tag set which is geared to on-the-fly rendering.
   (Although it is not the official Simplified DocBook which is
   described in Section B.5.) The OpenOffice simplified (or "special"
   docbook) is available from [http://www.chez.com/ebellot/ooo2sdbk/]
   http://www.chez.com/ebellot/ooo2sdbk/.
     ________________________________________________________________

E.2.1. Open Office 1.0.x

   OOo has been tested by LDP volunteers with mostly positive results.
   Thanks to Charles Curley ([http://www.charlescurley.com]
   charlescurley.com) for the following notes on using OOo version
   1.0.x:

   Note Check the version of your OpenOffice


   These notes may not apply to the version of OOo you are using.

     * To be able to export to DocBook, you must have a Java runtime
       environment (JRE) installed and registered with OOo--a minimum of
       version 4.2.x is recommended. The configuration instructions will
       depend on how you installed your JRE. Visit the OOo web site for
       help with your setup.
       Contrary to the OOo documentation, the Linux OOo did not come
       with a JRE. I got one from Sun.
     * The exported file has lots of empty lines. My 54 line exported
       file had 5 lines of actual XML code.
     * There was no effort at pretty printing.
     * The header is: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <!DOCTYPE
       article PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN"
       "http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.1.2/docbookx.dtd">
     * The pull-down menu in the File->Save As dialog box for file
       format indicates that the export format is "DocBook
       (simplified)." There is no explanation of what that "simplified"
       indicates. Does OOo export a subset of DocBook? If so, which
       elements are ignored? Is there any way to enter any of them
       manually?
     * There is NO documentation on the DocBook export filter or whether
       OOo will import it again.

   Conclusions: OOo 1.1RC is worth looking at if you want a word
   processor for preparing DocBook documents.

   However, I hope they cure the lack of documentation. For one thing,
   it would be nice to know which native OOo styles map to which DocBook
   elements. It would also be nice to know how to map one's own OOo
   styles to DocBook elements.
     ________________________________________________________________

E.2.2. Open Office 1.1

   [http://www.merlinmonroe.com] Tabatha Marshall offers the following
   additional information for OOo 1.1.

     The first problem was when I tried to do everything on version
     1.0.1. That was obviously a problem. I have RH8, and it was
     installed via rpm packages, so I ripped it out and did a full, new
     install of OpenOffice 1.1. It took a while to find out 1.1 was a
     requirement for XML to work.

     During the install process I believe I was offered the choice to
     install the XML features. I have a tendency to do full installs of
     my office programs, so I selected everything.

     I can't offer any advice to those trying to update their current
     OO 1.1. Their "3 ways" aren't documented very well at the site
     ([http://xml.openoffice.org] xml.openoffice.org) and as of this
     writing, I can't even find THAT on their site anymore. I think
     more current documentation is needed there to walk people through
     the process. Most of this was unclear and I had to pretty much
     experiment to get things working.

     Well, after I installed everything I had some configuration to do.
     I opened the application, and got started by opening a new file,
     choosing templates, then selecting the DocBook template. A nice
     menu of Paragraph Styles popped up for me, which are the names for
     all those tags, I noticed (you can see I don't use WYSIWYG often).

     With a blank doc before me (couldn't get to the XML Filter
     Settings menu unless some type of doc was opened), I went into
     Tools->XML Filter Settings, and edited the entry for DocBook file.
     I configured mine as follows:

     * Doctype -//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.2//EN
     * DTD http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/4.2/docbookx.dtd
     * XSLT for export
       /usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.1.0/share/xslt/docbook/ldp-html.xsl
     * XSLT for import
       /usr/local/OpenOffice.org1.1.0/share/xslt/docbook/docbooktosoffhe
       adings.xsl (this is the default)
     * Template for import
       /home/tabatha/OpenOffice/user/template/DocBook
       File/DocBookTemplate.stw

     At first, if I opened an XML file that had even one parsing error,
     it would just open the file anyway and display the markup in OO. I
     have many XML files that use &copy; and other types of entities
     which show up as parse errors (depending on the encoding) even
     though they can be processed through. But today I was unable to
     open any of those files. I got input/output errors instead. Still
     investigating that one.

     However when you do successfully open a document (one parsing with
     no errors), it puts it automatically into WYSIWYG based on the
     markup, and you can then work from the paragraph styles menu like
     any other such editor.

     To validate the document, I used Tools->XML Filter Settings, then
     clicked the Test XSLTs button. On my screen, I set up the XSLT for
     export to be ldp-html.xsl. If you test and there are errors, a new
     window pops up with error messages at the bottom, and the lines
     that need to be changed up at the top. You can change them there
     and progress through the errors until they're all gone, and keep
     testing until they're gone.

     If you want to open a file to see the source instead of the
     processed results, go to Tools->XML Filter Settings->Test XSLTs,
     and then under the Import section, check the Display Source box.
     My import XSLT is currently docbooktosoffheadings.xsl (the
     default) and the template for import is DocBookTemplate.stw (also
     default).

     I think this might work for some people, but unfortunately not for
     me. I've never used WYSIWYG to edit markup. Emacs with PSGML can
     tell me what my next tag is no matter where I am, validate by
     moving through the trouble spots, and I can parse and process from
     command line.

E.3. Microsoft Word to DocBook

   Even if you want to use MS Word to write your documents, you may find
   [http://www.docsoft.com/w2xmlv2.htm] w2XML useful. Note that this is
   not free software--the cost is around $130USD. There is, however, a
   trial version of the software.

E.4. LaTeX to DocBook

   Siep Kroonenberg reports that there is a package tex4ht
   [http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/]
   http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/ that converts TeX and
   LaTeX to various flavors of XML. Currently, its support for DocBook
   output is limited. If you want to use tex4ht in its current state for
   LDP you will probably have to hack your LaTeX source beforehand and
   the generated XML afterwords.

E.5. LyX to DocBook

   This section is contributed by Chris Karakas.

   You can use the LyX-to-X package to write your document conveniently
   in LyX (a visual editor originally developped as a graphical frontend
   to LaTeX), then export it to DocBook SGML and submit it to The LDP.
   This method is presented by [http://www.karakas-online.de] Chris
   Karakas Document processing with LyX and SGML.

   In the LyX-to-X project, LyX is used as a comfortable graphical SGML
   editor. Once the document is exported to SGML from LyX, it undergoes
   a series of transformations through sed and awk scripts that correct
   the SGML code, computes the Index, inserts the Bibliography and the
   Appendix and takes care of the correct invocation of openjade,
   pdftex, pdfjadetex and all the other necessary programs for the
   generation of HTML (chunked or not), PDF (with images, bookmarks,
   thumbnails and hyperlinks), PS, RTF and TXT versions.

   All aspects of document processing are handled, including automatic
   Index generation, display of Mathematics in TeX quality both online
   and in print formats, as well as the use of bibliographic databases
   with [http://refdb.sourceforge.net/] RefDB. Special care is taken so
   that the document processing is as transparent to the user as
   possible - the aim being that the user writes in LyX, then presses a
   button, and the LyX-to-X script does the rest. Download the
   documentation and the LyX-to-X package from the
   [http://www.karakas-online.de/mySGML/formats.html] Formats section.

E.6. DocBook to DocBook Transformations

E.6.1. XML and SGML DocBook

   There are a few changes between DocBook XML and SGML. Handling these
   differences should be relatively easy for most small documents, and
   many authors will not need to make any changes to convert their
   documents other than the XML and DocBook declarations at the start of
   their document.

   For others, here is a list of what you should keep in mind when
   converting your documents from SGML to XML.

   Note Differences between XML and SGML elements


   An XML element typically has three parts: the start tag, the content
   (your words) and the end tag. Qualifiers are added in the start tag
   and are known as attributes. They will always have a name and a
   quoted value.
<filename class="directory">/usr/local<filename>

   The start tag contains one attribute (class) with a value of
   "directory". The end tag (also filename) must not contain any
   attributes.

     * Element names (tags) and their attributes are
       case-dependent--typically lowercase. The following will not
       validate because the end tag <PARA> is uppercase:

<para>This part will fail XML validation</PARA>

     * All attributes in the start tag must be "quoted". This can be
       either single (') or double (") quotes, but not reverse (`) or
       "smart quotes". The quote used to start a name="value" pair must
       be the same quote used at the end of the value. In other words:
       "this" would validate, but 'that" would not.
     * Tags that have a start tag, but no end tag are referred to as
       "empty" because they do not contain (wrap around) anything. These
       tags must still be closed with a trailing slash (/). For example:
       xref must be written as <xref linkend="software"/>. You may not
       have any spaces between the / and >. (Although you may have a
       space after the final attribute: <xref linkend="foo" />.)
     * Processing instructions that get sent to the transformation
       engine (DSSSL or XSLT) and must have a question mark at the end
       of the tag. All processing instructions are removed from the
       output stream. The XML version of this tag would look like this:

<?dbhtml filename="foo"?>

     * If you're converting from SGML to XML, be sure file names refer
       to .xml files instead of .sgml. Some tools may get confused if a
       .sgml file contains XML.
     * Tag minimizations were used in SGML instead of writing out the
       element name in the end tag. Example: <para>This is foo.</> Tag
       minimizations are not supported in XML and their use is
       discouraged in DocBook.
     ________________________________________________________________

E.6.2. Changing DTDs

   The significant changes between version changes in the DTD involve
   changes to the elements (tags). Elements may be: deprecated (which
   means they will be removed in future versions); removed; modified; or
   added. Almost all authors will run into a changed or deprecated tag
   when going from a lower version of DocBook to a higher version.

   DocBook: The Definitive Guide does an excellent job of showing you
   how elements fit together. For each element it tells you what an
   element must contain (its content model) and what is may be contained
   in (who its parents are). For example: a note must contain a para. If
   you try to write <note>Content in a note</note> your document will
   not validate. Learning how elements are assembled will make it a lot
   easier to understand any validation errors that are thrown at you. If
   you get truly stuck you can also email the LDP's docbook mailing list
   for extra hints. Information on subscribing is available from Section
   2.2

   All tags that have been deprecated or changed for 4.x are listed in
   DocBook: The definitive guide, published by O'Reilly and Associates.
   This book is also available on-line from [http://www.docbook.org]
   http://www.docbook.org.
     ________________________________________________________________

E.6.2.1. Differences between version 3.x and 4.x

   Here are a few elements that are of particular relevance to LDP
   authors:

     * artheader. has been changed to articleinfo. Most other header
       elements have been renamed to info.
     * graphic. has been deprecated and will be removed as of DocBook
       5.x. To prepare for this, start using mediaobject. There is more
       information about mediaobject in Section D.5.
     * imagedata. file formats must now be written in UPPERCASE letters.
       If you use lowercase or mixed-case spellings for your file
       formats, it will fail.
       Valid:

<imagedata format="EPS" fileref="foo.eps">

       Invalid:

<imagedata format="eps" fileref="foo.eps">

Glossary

   Abiword
          Open Source word processor.

   aspell
          Spell check program.

   attribute
          An attribute makes available extra information regarding the
          element on which it appears. The attributes always appear as a
          name-value pair on the initialization pointers (i.e. the
          "start tag"). Example of an attribute is id="identification",
          which gives the attribute id the value identification.

   Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
          Set of overlay rules that are read by your HTML browser, which
          uses these rules for doing the display, layout and formatting
          of the XML-generated HTML file(s). CSS allows for fast changes
          in look and feel without having to plunge in the HTML file(s).

   Catalog
          Helper file for the display and transformation tools, which
          maps public identifiers and URLs to the local file system.

   Concurrent Versions System (CVS)
          A common document management system used by the LDP.

   DocBook
          An SGML (and XML) application, describing a document format
          that allows easy management of documentation.

   docbook-utils
          Software package easing XML conversions.

   Document Type Definition (DTD)
          A group of statements that define element names and their
          attributes specifying the rules for combinations and
          sequences. It's the DTD that defines which elements can or
          cannot be inserted in the given context.

   DSSSL
          DSSSL stands for Document Style Semantics and Specification
          Language. It's an ISO standard (ISO/IEC 10179:1996). The DSSSL
          standard is internationally used as a language for documents
          style sheets pages for SGML.

   element
          The elements describe the content's structure in a document.
          Most elements contain a start tag, content and a closing tag.
          For example a paragraph element includes all of the following
          <para>This is the paragraph.</para>. Some elements are "empty"
          and do not contain content and a closing tag. An example of
          this is a link to an external document where the URL is
          printed to the page. This element would include only the
          following <ulink url="http://google.com/>.

   Emacs
          Popular text editor, especially on UNIX systems or alikes.

   entity
          An entity is a name designated for some part of data so that
          it can be referenced by a name. The data could be anything
          from from simple characters to chapters to sets of statements
          in a DTD. Entity parameters can be generic, external, internal
          or SGML data. An entity is similar to a variable in a
          programming language, or a macro.

   epcEdit
          Cross-platform XML editor.

   external entity
          An external entity points to an external document. External
          entities are used to include texts on certain locations of a
          SGML document. It could be used to include sample screens,
          legal notes, and chapters for example.

   float
          Objects such as side bars, pictures, tables, and charts are
          called floats when they don't have a fixed placement on the
          text. For printed text, a chart can appear either at the top
          or at the bottom of the page. It can also be placed on the
          next page if it is too large.

   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
          LDP hosts a number of documents that are a list in the form of
          questions and answers. These documents are called FAQs. A FAQ
          is usually a single-page document.

   generic entities
          An entity referenced by a name, which starts with "&" and ends
          with semicolon is a generic entity. Most of the time this type
          of entity is used in the document and not on the DTD. There
          are two types of entities: external and internal. They can
          refer to special characters or to text objects such as
          repeated sentences, names or chapters.

   GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL)
          Like the GNU Public License for free software, but with
          specifics for written text and documentation with software.

          those changes if you want, on the condition that you keep on
          using the same license for your derived works.

   Guide
          TLDP documents that are too long to be a HOWTO are usually
          stored as guides. These are more like entire books that treat
          a particular subject in-dept.

   HOWTO
          Documents that discuss how to do something with a system or
          application. Most documents hosted at TLDP are HOWTOs,
          explaining how to install, configure or manage tens of
          applications on a variety of systems. HOWTOs are typically
          10-25 pages.

   internal entity
          An internal entity refers to part of the text and is often
          used as a shortcut for frequently repeated text.

   ispell
          Spell check program.

   Jade

          An entity type often used in the DTD or a document's internal
          subset. The entity's name starts with a percent sign (%) and
          ends with a semicolon.

   PSGML
          Emacs major mode that customizes Emacs for editing SGML
          documents.

   Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards
          (OASIS)

          processing instructions for naming files when it is rendered
          into HTML: <?dbhtml filename="file.html">

   PostScript (PS)
          Document format designed for printable documents. PS is the
          standard print format on UNIX(-alikes).

   Reviewer, review process
          TLDP doesn't accept just anything. Once you submit a document,
          it will be checked for consistency, grammar, spelling and
          style by a reviewer, a volunteer assigned by the review
          coordinator.

   SGML
          Standard Generalized Markup Language. It is an international
          standard (ISO8879) that specifies rules for the creation of
          electronic documents in markup systems, regardless of the
          platform used.

   Subject and scope
          Obviously, the subject is what your documentation is about.

Appendix F. GNU Free Documentation License

F.1. 0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
   written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
   the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
   this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
   credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
   modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals;
   it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.2. 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
   such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
   addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
   of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document
   is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
   explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of
   historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of
   legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
   regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
   that the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
   of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
   available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
   formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
   suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise
   Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or
   discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A
   copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
   PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
   by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
   material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works
   in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page"
   means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
   title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.3. 2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.4. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
   100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
   legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front
   cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in
   addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
   preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
   be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque
   copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
   complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material,
   which the general network-using public has access to download
   anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If
   you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
   when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure
   that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
   location until at least one year after the last time you distribute
   an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that
   edition to the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
   the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
   to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.5. 4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

     * A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
       distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
       versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
       History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a
       previous version if the original publisher of that version gives
       permission.
     * B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       less than five).
     * C. State on the Title Page the name of the publisher of the
       Modified Version, as the publisher.
     * D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     * E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     * F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
       notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
       under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the
       Addendum below.
     * G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
     * H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     * I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and
       add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors,
       and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
       If there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create
       one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the
       Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing
       the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
     * J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
       for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
       likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous
       versions it was based on. These may be placed in the "History"
       section. You may omit a network location for a work that was
       published at least four years before the Document itself, or if
       the original publisher of the version it refers to gives
       permission.
     * K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
     * L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
       in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the
       equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     * M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may
       not be included in the Modified Version.
     * N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or
   all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to
   the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license
   notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
   a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
   list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version .
     ________________________________________________________________

F.6. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique
   number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   entitled "Endorsements."
     ________________________________________________________________

F.7. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
   rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
   in all other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   dispbibute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.8. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
   of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus
   compiled with the Document , on account of their being thus compiled,
   if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the
   Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of
   the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the
   entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers
   that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they
   must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.9. 8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License provided that you also include the
   original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this
   License, the original English version will prevail.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.10. 9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other
   attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
   void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
   License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from
   you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
   long as such parties remain in full compliance.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.11. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft] http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version
   or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by
   the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a
   version number of this License, you may choose any version ever
   published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     ________________________________________________________________

F.12. Addendum

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and
   license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright  YEAR YOUR NAME.

     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this
     document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License,
     Version 1.1 or any later version published by the Free Software
     Foundation; with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES,
     with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover
     Texts being LIST. A copy of the license is included in the section
     entitled "GNU Free Documentation License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no
   Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
   "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.

   should also remember that the way this appears to you depends on the
   format in which you are reading this document: online appearance is
   slightly different from the PostScript or PDF ones.

   In truth, "XSL" is actually comprised of three components: the XSLT
   transformation language, the XPath expression language (used by
   XSLT), and XSL Formatting Objects (FO) that are used for describing a
   page. The style sheets are actually written in XSLT and generate
   either HTML or (for print output) FO. The FO file is then run through
   a FO processor to create the actual print (PDF or PostScript) output.
   See the W3C web site for more information.

   In XSL terminology, the process of generating multiple files is
   referred to as "chunking".
