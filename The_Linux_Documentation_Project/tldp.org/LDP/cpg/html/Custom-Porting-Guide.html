>HardHat Linux</EM
>: First and foremost, HHLinux, now known
   as MontaVista Linux, is the distribution we started with. The distribution contains LSPs (same as BSPs)
   for PowerPC in a number of board configurations. For porting to our board, we took the LSP which
   is closest in hardware to our Artysyn PMPPC board, and started from there.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>LXR</EM
>: This is THE killer tool, which allowed us to port
   Linux in a very short time. LXR is a cross referencer, which means it reads a piece of code
   (the Linux kernel, for example), and then allows browsing the code, searching through it and
   much more. I cannot emphasize enough how important this tool is. To see what the end
   result looks like, look at <A
HREF="http://lxr.linux.no/source"

><LI
><P
><EM
>VisionICE</EM
>: A hardware debugger, which has the ability
   to stop, run and add breakpoint straight in the CPU. VisionIce is very usuful when no operating
   system is running, and allows to step in the kernel during boot process. The application can also be used to
   take a binary image of a kernel, load it into the target's RAM memory and run it - useful
   when you've got no boot loader.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
><EM
>CVS</EM
>: A version control system, allows you to keep
   multiple versions of the code. Other than backing up the code, it allows diffing between
   different version, and reverting to older version, when needed.</P

>2.1. Creating a development environment</H1
><P
>The minimum requirments are obviously a development station and a target. However,
the recommended way of working is having a third host which acts as a server. The server
runs several services such as ftp, telnet, NFS, tftp (if needed) and CVS. The main role of
the server is to run CVS and track version control, however once you can boot the target
from network, the server will also hold the target images, and filesystem,
which makes development much easier.</P
><P
>Regardless, the first step is to install a tool-chain (compiler, linker etc.) for your 
target. The HardHat Linux cdrom includes all the needed files, and the installation sequence
is documented in the HardHat Linux documentation. During the installation, you must select 
your LSP (basic software for the selected board), and HardHat will install a set of tools 
and a kernel source tree matching your LSP.</P
><P
>We had a board that had vxWorks running on it, so we setup the target to boot 
using the standard vxWorks loader. Once the loader initiated, we used visionICE to take-over 
the target (so that vxWorks won't load an image file) and load a Linux image into the target. 
What you need to do at this point is get an ICE, connect it to the network and to the target -
through a JTAG connection - and install the ICE software on your host.</P

initialization code of the kernel and rule out some potential problems, like virtual memory
errors, only to finally discover that the problem was simple: the kernel was indeed booting
but since the console (tty) driver had problems, we couldn't see anything!

and the oldest way is good here - printing to the screen. Obviously, we couldn't use <TT

>3.2. Modifying code using compiler flags</H1
><P
>Although it is not a porting issue, the way you modify your code matters. It's easier if you do it right the
first time. The Linux kernel uses standard configuration flags CONFIG_XXXX (like CONFIG_PPC, CONFIG_ISA etc),
which are used to mark a certain machine, architecture or device. We defined ourselves a new flag (let's call
it CONFIG_TESTMACH), and surrounded our new/modified code with these flags:

To <SPAN

way to find the code you changed, but later the flag you chose will allow you to add your code into the

As you can see, our i8559er needs IRQ 22, and is seated in IDselect 3. Of course, we didn't know that at the start, so we wrote a small piece of code that read all the vendor IDs in all the IDselects.  Once done we compiled, but the ethernet device still didn't work.</P
><P
>The next problem was that the module couldn't decide on a MAC address for the device. The MAC address should be written on an EEPROM chip (connected to the device), but we discovered that the hardware guys decided that i82559 doesn't need the EEPROM, so they removed it.  After hardcoding a MAC address inside <TT
CLASS="filename"
>eepro100.c</TT
>, the ethernet device finally worked.  The final solution was to make the module read the MAC address from NVRAM memory, and if no other choice was available, to fall back to a default MAC address.

This is a problem since some test-and-set registers on our board might get set unintentionally, because we were trying to read something 16 bits lower. In order to solve this situation, we set the memory controller to 64 bit wide intervals.  If you try to access those areas in another manner (8 or 16 bit access), the CPC700 simply throws them away.  We had to be able to read/write those areas, since important <SPAN

><P
>In order to access those areas, we needed a function that does a 64 bit write.  As far as I know, doing a 64 bit write on a PowerPC is possible in two ways:  using cache lines and using a floating point register.  The floating point register is a 64 bit sized register, so when we write it, the whole 64 bit get written. The problem is that you can't do floating point in the kernel. Since the kernel doesn't save the floating point registers during context switch, it doesn't allow FP, and will throw an exception if done in the kernel.</P

The function adds a floating point to the PowerPC MSR register, and makes sure that no exceptions will be generated as a result of doing FP. Once done, it uses an assembly code, described below in the <TT

>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook,
    or other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
    assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
    with or without modifying it, either commercially or
    noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
    author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
    being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that
    derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
    same sense.  It complements the GNU General Public License, which
    is a copyleft license designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals
    for free software, because free software needs free documentation:
    a free program should come with manuals providing the same
    freedoms that the software does.  But this License is not limited
    to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work,
    regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a
    printed book.  We recommend this License principally for works
    whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

>A.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H1
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work that
    contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License.  The "Document",
    below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member of the
    public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work
    containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied
    verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another
    language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
    section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
    nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
    (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
    mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
    The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
    the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections
    whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections,
    in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that
    are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification
    is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed
    and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text
    editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs
    or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic
    translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
    whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
    modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
    "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include
    plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
    format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
    standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
    Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
    can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
    or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
    itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
    the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
    "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
    the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
    text.</P

>A.3. VERBATIM COPYING</H1
><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium,
    either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this
    License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this
    License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and
    that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this
    License.  You may not use technical measures to obstruct or
    control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or
    distribute.  However, you may accept compensation in exchange for
    copies.  If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P

    above, and you may publicly display copies.</P

>A.4. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H1
><P
>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the
    authors of the Document well before redistributing any large
    number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an
    updated version of the Document.</P

    Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided
    that you release the Modified Version under precisely this
    License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the
    Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
    Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition,

      least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
      publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.</P

>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections
    or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
    material copied from the Document, you may at your option
    designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
    add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
    Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
    other section titles.</P

>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it
    contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
    various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
    the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
    definition of a standard.</P

>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover
    Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the
    end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
    passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
    added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
    Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
    previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
    you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
    publisher that added the old one.</P

    the same name but different contents, make the title of each such
    section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
    name of the original author or publisher of that section if known,

    titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of

    copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
    called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the

    account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
    derivative works of the Document.</P
