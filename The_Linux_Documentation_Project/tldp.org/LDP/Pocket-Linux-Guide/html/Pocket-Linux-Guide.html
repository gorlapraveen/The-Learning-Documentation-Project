>The Pocket Linux Guide is for anyone interested in learning the
      techniques of building a GNU/Linux system from source code. The guide is
      structured as a project that builds a small diskette-based GNU/Linux
      system called Pocket Linux. Each chapter explores a small piece of the
      overall system explaining how it works, why it is needed and how to
      build it. After completing the Pocket Linux project, readers should
      possess an enhanced knowledge of what makes GNU/Linux systems work as
      well as the confidence to explore larger, more complex source-code-only
      projects.</P

>3. Project Format</H1
><P
> The Pocket Linux Guide takes a hands-on approach to learning. The
    guide is written with each chapter building a piece of an overall project.
    Chapters are further broken into sections of Analysis, Design,
    Construction and Implementation. This format is derived from Rapid
    Application Development (RAD) methodology. Without going into detail about
    design methodologies, the sections may be summed up as follows. </P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The Analysis section gives a high-level overview of what is to
        be accomplished in each chapter. It will introduce the tasks that need
        to be completed and why they are important to the overall
        system.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The Design section defines the source code packages, files and
        configuration necessary to address the requirements set forth in the
        Analysis section. Much of the theory of why certain system files exist
        and what their purpose is can be found here.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The Construction section is where all the hands-on action takes
        place. This section goes into detail about building source code and
        configuring the system files.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The Implementation section will test the proper operation of the
        project at the end of each chapter. Often there are a few shell
        commands to perform and samples of expected screen outputs are
        given.</P

>1.1. A Brief History of GNU/Linux</H1
><P
>In the early 90's GNU/Linux systems consisted of little more than a
    beta-quality Linux kernel and a small collection of software ported from
    the GNU project. It was a true hacker's operating system. There were no
    CD-ROM's or GUI installation tools; everything had to be compiled and
    configured by the end user. Being a Linux Expert meant knowing your system
    inside and out.</P
><P
>Toward the middle of the decade several GNU/Linux distributions
    began appearing. One of the first was <A
HREF="http://www.slackware.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>Slackware</A
> in 1993 and since then
    there have been many others. Even though there are many "flavors" of Linux
    today, the main purpose of the distribution remains the same. The
    distribution automates many of the tasks involved in GNU/Linux
    installation and configuration taking the burden off of the system
    administrator. Being a Linux Expert now means knowing which button to
    click in the GUI administration tool.</P
><P
>Recently there has been a yearn for a return to the "good old days"
    of Linux when men were men, sysadmins were hardcore geeks and everything
    was compiled from source code. A notable indication of this movement was
    the publication of the Linux-From-Scratch-HOWTO version 1.0 by Gerard
    Beekmans in 1999. Being a Linux Expert once again means knowing how to do
    it yourself.</P

>1.2. The Goal of Pocket Linux</H1
><P
>The purpose of Pocket Linux is to support and encourage people who
    wish to explore Linux by building a GNU/Linux system from nothing but
    source code. Pocket Linux is not intended to be a full featured system,
    but rather to give the reader a taste of what is involved in building an
    operating system from source code. After completing the Pocket Linux
    system the reader should have enough knowledge to confidently build almost
    any project using only source code. Given this direction we can put a few
    constraints on the project.</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>The main focus should be learning. The project should not just
        describe how to do something, it should also describe why it should be
        done.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The required time commitment should be minimal and
        manageable.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The project should not require any investment in additional
        hardware or reconfiguration of existing hardware to set up a lab
        environment.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Readers should not need to know any programming languages in
        order to complete the project.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>To remain true to the spirit of GNU/Linux, all software used in
        the project should be covered under the GNU/GPL or another, similarly
        liberal, open-source license.</P
></LI
></UL

>1.3. Working Within The Constraints</H1
><P
>The Pocket Linux project gets its name from the fact that the bulk
    of the project fits onto two diskettes making it possible to carry the
    entire, working system around in one's pocket. This has the advantage of
    not requiring any additional hardware since any PC can be booted from the
    diskettes without disrupting any OS that exists on the hard drive. Using
    diskettes also partially addresses the aspect of time commitment, because
    the project size and complexity is necessarily limited by the 1.44
    Megabyte size of the installation media.</P
><P
>To further reduce the time commitment, the Pocket Linux project is
    divided into several phases, each one chapter in length. Each phase builds
    only a small piece of the overall project, but at the same time the
    conclusion of each chapter results in a self-contained, working system.
    This step-by-step approach should allow readers to pace themselves and not
    feel the need to rush to see results.</P
><P
>Chapters are further subdivided into four sections. The first two
    sections, analysis and design, focus on the theory of what is to be
    accomplished in each phase and why. The last two sections, construction
    and implementation, detail the steps needed to do the actual building.
    Advanced readers, who may be familiar with the theories laid out in a
    particular chapter are encouraged to gloss over the analysis and design
    sections in the interest of time. The separation of theory from hands-on
    exercises should allow readers of all skill levels to complete the project
    without feeling either completely lost or mired in too much detail.</P
><P
>Finally, the Pocket Linux project will strive to use GNU/GPL
    software when possible and other open-source licensed software when there
    is no GNU/GPL alternative. Also, Pocket Linux will never require any
    programming more complex than a BASH shell script.</P

>Since this is the first phase of the project it will be kept very
    simple. The goal here is not to create the ultimate GNU/Linux system on
    the first try. Instead, we will be building a very minimal, working system
    to be used as a building block in subsequent phases of the project.
    Keeping this in mind, we can list a few goals for phase one.</P

>Take a moment to skim through the Bootdisk-HOWTO or the

      online at <A
HREF="../../../docs.html#howto"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#howto</A
>.
      Both documents offer an excellent view of what it takes to get a
      GNU/Linux system up and running. There is also a lot of information to
      digest. Remember that one of our goals is, "keep it simple to avoid
      stressing out," so we want to ignore everything but the absolutely
      critical pieces of a boot / root diskset.</P

></UL
><P
>We don't even need an init daemon. The kernel can be told to run
      the shell directly by passing it an option through the boot
      loader.</P
><P
>For easy construction we will build a two-disk boot / root set
      rather than trying to get everything onto a single diskette. The boot
      loader and kernel will go on the boot disk and the shell will reside on
      the root disk.</P

>2.2.2. Boot Disk</H2
><P
>For the boot disk we simply need to install the GRUB bootloader
      and a Linux kernel. We will need to use a kernel that does not require
      modules for the hardware we need to access. Mainly, it should have
      compiled-in support for the floppy drive, ram disk, second extended
      filesystem, proc filesystem, ELF binaries, and a text-based console. If
      such a kernel is not available, it will need to be built from source
      code. Kwan Lowe's <A
HREF="http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Kernel
      Rebuild Guide</A
> is a good reference for this task, however we can
      ignore the sections that deal with modules and the initial
      ramdisk.</P

>2.2.3. Root Disk</H2
><P
>For the root disk we will need a floppy that has been prepared
      with a filesystem. We will also need a BASH shell that is
      statically-linked so we can avoid the additional complexities of shared
      libraries. The <B
CLASS="command"
>configure</B
> program in the BASH source
      code recognizes the <TT
CLASS="option"
>--enable-static-link</TT
> option for
      this feature. We will also be using the
      <TT
CLASS="option"
>--enable-minimal-config</TT
> option to keep the BASH binary
      down to a manageable size. Additional requirements for the root disk are
      a <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/dev</TT
> directory and a device file for the console.
      The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>console</TT
> device is required for BASH to be able
      to communicate with the keyboard and video display.</P

>2.2.4. CPU Compatibility</H2
><P
>There is one other, less obvious requirement to keep in mind and
      that is CPU compatibility. Each generation of CPU features a more
      complex architecture than its predecessor. Late generation chips have
      additional registers and instructions when compared to an older 486 or
      386. So a kernel optimized for a new, fast 6x86 machine will not run on
      an older box. (See the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>README</TT
> file in the Linux
      kernel source code for details.) A BASH shell built for a 6x86 will
      probably not run on an older processor either. To avoid this problem, we
      can choose the 386 as a lowest common denominator CPU and build all the
      code for that architecture.</P

>One of the drawbacks in the prototype phase of the project was that
    the diskset was not all that useful. The only commands that worked were
    the ones built into the BASH shell. We could improve our root disk by
    installing commands like <B
CLASS="command"
>cat</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>ls</B
>,
    <B
CLASS="command"
>mv</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>rm</B
> and so on. Unfortunately, we
    are short on space. The current root disk has no shared libraries so each
    utility would have to be statically-linked just like the BASH shell. A lot
    of big binaries together with a static shell will rapidly exceed the tiny
    1.44M of available disk space. So our main goal in this phase should be to
    maximize space savings on the root disk and pave the way for expanded
    functionality in the next phase.</P

    utilities can be squeezed onto a 1.44M floppy. There are three things that
    make this possible. One is the use of shared libraries. The second is
    stripped binaries. And the third is the use of a compressed filesystem. We
    can use all of these techniques to save space on our root disk.</P

>3.2.1. Shared Libraries</H2
><P
>First, in order to use shared libraries we will need to rebuild
      the BASH shell. This time we will configure it without using the
      <TT
CLASS="option"
>--enable-static-link</TT
> option. Once BASH is rebuilt we
      need to figure out which libraries it is linked with and be sure to
      include them on the root disk. The <B
CLASS="command"
>ldd</B
> command makes
      this job easy. By typing <B
CLASS="command"
>ldd bash</B
> on the command-line
      we can see a list of all the shared libraries that BASH uses. As long as
      all these libraries are copied to the root disk, the new BASH build
      should work fine.</P

>3.2.2. Stripped Binaries</H2
><P
>Next, we should strip any binaries that get copied to the root
      disk. The manpage for <B
CLASS="command"
>strip</B
> does not give much
      description of what it does other than to say, "strip discards all
      symbols from the object files." It seems like removing pieces of a
      binary would render it useless, but this is not the case. The reason it
      works is because a large number of these discarded symbols are used for
      debugging. While debugging symbols are very helpful to programmers
      working to improve the code, they do not do much for the average
      end-user other than take up more disk space. And since space is at a
      premium, we should definitely remove as many symbols as possible from
      BASH and any other binaries before we copy over them to the
      ramdisk.</P
><P
>The process of stripping files to save space also works with
      shared library files. But when stripping libraries it is important to
      use the <TT
CLASS="option"
>--strip-unneeded</TT
> option so as not to break
      them. Using <TT
CLASS="option"
>--strip-unneeded</TT
> shrinks the file size, but
      leaves the symbols needed for relocation intact which is something that
      shared libraries need to function properly.</P

>3.2.3. Compressed Root Filesystem</H2
><P
>Finally, we can tackle the problem of how to build a compressed
      root filesystem. The Bootdisk-HOWTO suggests three ways of constructing
      a compressed root filesystem using either a ramdisk, a spare hard drive
      partition or a loopback device. This project will concentrate on using
      the ramdisk approach. It seems logical that if the root filesystem is
      going to be run from a ramdisk, it may as well be built on a ramdisk.
      All we have to do is create a second extended filesystem on a ramdisk
      device, mount it and copy files to it. Once the filesystem is populated
      with all the files that the root disk needs, we simply unmount it,
      compress it and write it out to floppy.</P

>Using <B

          symbols from the library on the ramdisk without altering the

          are lost when copying libraries this way which is why the

      the manpage search engines listed at <A
HREF="../../../docs.html#man"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.tldp.org/docs.html#man</A

      One thing that should tip us off as to where to find the source code for
      a particular command is the email address listed for reporting bugs. For
      example the cat manpage lists bug-textutils@gnu.org. From this email
      address we can deduce that <B

      are <B
CLASS="command"
>cat</B

CLASS="command"

CLASS="command"
>cat</B
> is
      part of GNU's textutils. Using the next few commands as keywords in a
      manpage search we discover that we need GNU's fileutils package for
      <B
CLASS="command"
>chmod</B

CLASS="command"
>chgrp</B

      <B

      The <B

>In the previous chapter we added many new commands by installing
    coreutils and as a result the root disk has a lot more functionality. But
    there are still a few things lacking. One thing that really stands out is
    that there was no way to mount disks. In order to get a read-write root
    filesystem we had to resort to passing the <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>rw</I
></TT
>
    kernel parameter at the <TT
CLASS="prompt"
>grub&#62;</TT
> prompt. This is fine for
    an emergency situation, but a normal system boot process should do things
    differently.</P
><P
>Most GNU/Linux distributions take several steps to mount
    filesystems. Watching the boot process or digging into the startup scripts
    on one of the popular Linux distributions reveals the following sequence
    of events:</P

>The rest of the local filesystems are mounted.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Network filesystems are mounted.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>So far our Pocket Linux system can do step one and that is it. If we
    want to have a professional looking boot / root diskset we will have to do
    better than one out of five. In this phase of the project we will work on
    steps two and three. Steps four and five can wait. Since this is a
    diskette-based system, there really are no other filesystems to mount
    besides root.</P

>We can use the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) document to

      directory structure. The FHS <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/sbin</TT
> directory lists
      <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> and something called <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck.*</B
>
      for checking filesystems. Since we are using a Second Extended (ext2)
      filesystem the <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck.*</B

      <B
CLASS="command"

      <B

>umount</B

      However, the name of a script to automatically mount local filesystems
      cannot be found. On most systems this type of script is in the
      <TT
CLASS="filename"

      requirements for <TT

      recommendations for startup scripts. Several GNU/Linux distributions use

>5.2.2. Finding source code</H2
><P
>In the previous chapter we used manpages to help us find source
      code. In this chapter we will use a tool called the Linux Software Map
      (LSM). LSM is a database of GNU/Linux software that tracks such things
      as package name, author, names of binaries that make up the package and
      download sites. Using an LSM search engine we can locate packages using
      command names as keywords.</P
><P
>If we search Ibiblio's Linux Software Map (LSM) at <A
HREF="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/</A
>
      for the keyword "fsck" we get a large number of matches. Since we are
      using a Second Extended filesystem, called ext2 for short, we can refine
      the search using "ext2" as a keyword. Supplying both keywords to the LSM
      search engine comes up with a package called e2fsprogs. Looking at the
      LSM entry for e2fsprogs we find out that this package contains the
      utilities <B
CLASS="command"
>e2fsck</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>mke2fs</B
>,
      <B
CLASS="command"
>dumpe2fs</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> and more. We also
      find out that the LSM entry for e2fsprogs has not been updated for a
      while. There is almost certainly a newer version out there somewhere.
      Another good Internet resource for source code is SourceForge at <A
HREF="http://sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sourceforge.net/</A
>. Using the
      keyword "e2fsprogs" in the SourceForge search engine results in a much
      newer version of e2fsprogs.</P
><P
>Finding <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> was quite an adventure, but now we
      can move on to finding <B
CLASS="command"
>mount</B
> and
      <B
CLASS="command"
>umount</B
>. A search on LSM comes up with a number of
      matches, but most of them point to various versions of a package called
      util-linux. All we have to do is scroll through and pick the most recent
      release. The LSM entry for util-linux lists a lot of utilities besides
      just mount and umount. We should definitely scan through the list to see
      if any of the other util-linux commands show up in the FHS requirements
      for <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"

>5.2.3. Automating fsck and mount</H2
><P
>Now that we have <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> and
      <B
CLASS="command"
>mount</B
> commands we need to come up with a shell script
      to automate checking and mounting the local filesystems. An easy way to
      do this would be to write a short, two line script that calls
      <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> and then <B
CLASS="command"
>mount</B
>. But, what if
      the filesystems are not clean? The system should definitely not try to
      mount a corrupted filesystem. Therefore we need to devise a way of
      determining the status of the filesystems before mounting them. The
      manpage for <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> gives some insight into how this can
      be accomplished using return codes. Basically, if
      <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> returns a code of zero or one it means the
      filesystem is okay and a return code of two or greater means some kind
      of manual intervention is needed. A simple if-then statement could
      evaluate the <B
CLASS="command"
>fsck</B
> return code to determine whether or
      not the filesystem should be mounted. For help on writing shell scripts
      we can turn to the BASH(1) manpage and the
      Advanced-BASH-Scripting-Guide. Both references are freely available from
      the Linux Documentation Project web site at <A

      points, <TT

>/etc/mtab</TT

      the various disks. We will need to include all of these to have
      everything work right.</P

>The <TT
CLASS="filename"

        file that can be created with any editor. We will need an entry for
        the root filesystem and for the proc filesystem. Information about the
        format of this file can be found in the fstab(5) manpage or by looking

><P
>The <TT

>/etc/mtab</TT

        challenge, because it does not contain static information like
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>fstab</TT
>. The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>mtab</TT
> file tracks
        mounted filesystems and therefore its contents change from time to
        time. We are particularly interested in the state of
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>mtab</TT
> when the system first starts up, before any
        filesystems are mounted. At this point <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/mtab</TT
>
        should be empty so we will need to configure a startup script to
        create an empty <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc/mtab</TT
> before any filesystems
        are mounted. But it is not possible to create any files in the
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/etc</TT
> directory because <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/</TT
> is
        read-only at startup. This creates a paradox. We cannot create an
        empty <TT
CLASS="filename"
>mtab</TT
>, because the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/</TT
>
        filesystem is not mounted as writable and we should not mount any
        filesystems until we have created an empty <TT
CLASS="filename"
>mtab</TT
>.
        In order to sidestep this problem we need to do the following:</P

TYPE="1"

><P
>Remount <TT

            not attempt to write an entry to <TT

    commands for checking and mounting filesystems. But even with all of this

>Searching the Linux Software Map on Ibiblio for the keyword "init"
      gives a large number of results. From reading the
      From-Powerup-To-BASH-Prompt-HOWTO however, we know that most Linux
      systems use a System V style init daemon. Narrowing the search with the
      additional key phrase of "System V" gives much better results. The
      sysvinit package contains <B
CLASS="command"

      <B
CLASS="command"
>shutdown</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>halt</B

      <B

      listed in the LSM entry looks to be pretty old, but there is a
      primary-site URL that will probably lead to the latest version.</P

>Using a GRUB configuration file is slightly more complex than
      specifying the bootloader commands manually. There are directives for
      features like menus, default selections and timeouts that need to be
      specified in the configuration file as well as the familiar kernel
      loading command. The info page for GRUB gives much of the necessary
      information. We may also be able to use the GRUB configuration file on
      the development system as a template. However, there is some
      inconsistency between vendors as to the name and location of the file.
      Regardless of what the path is on the development system it should be
      <TT

>Up to now the system has been operating in single-user mode. There
    is no login process and anyone who boots the system goes straight into a
    shell with root privileges. Obviously, this is not the normal operating
    mode for most GNU/Linux distributions. Most systems feature multi-user
    capability where many users can access the system simultaneously with
    different privilege levels. These multi-user systems also support virtual
    consoles so that the keyboard and video display can be multiplexed between
    several terminal sessions. So in this phase we would like to add the
    following enhancements to the system:</P

>7.2.5. Assigning ownership and permissions</H2
><P
>Previously, with the single user system, there was no need to
      worry about permissions when installing directories, files and device
      nodes. The shell was effectively operating as root, so everything was
      accessible. Things become more complex with the addition of multiple
      user capability. Now we need to make sure that every user has access to
      what they need and at the same time gets blocked from what they do not
      need.</P
><P
>A good guideline for assigning ownership and permissions would be
      to give the minimum level of access required. Take the
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin</TT
> directory as an example. The Filesystem
      Hierarchy (FHS) document says, "<TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin</TT
> contains
      commands that may be used by both the system administrator and by
      users". From that statement we can infer that <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin</TT
>
      should have read and execute permission for everyone. On the other hand,
      the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/boot</TT
> directory contains files for the boot
      loader. Chances are good that regular users will not need to access
      anything in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/boot</TT
> directory. So the minimum
      level of access would be read permission for the root user and other
      administrators who are members of the root group. Normal users would
      have no permissions assigned on the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/boot</TT
>
      directory.</P
><P
>Most of the time we can assign similar permissions to all the
      commands in a directory, but there are some programs that prove to be
      exceptions to the rule. The <B
CLASS="command"
>su</B
> command is a good
      example. Other commands in the /bin directory have a minimum requirement
      of read and execute, but the <B
CLASS="command"
>su</B
> command needs to be
      setuid root in order to run correctly. Since it is a setuid binary, it
      might not be a good idea to allow just anyone to run it. Ownership of
      0:0 (root user, root group) and permissions of rwsr-x--- (octal 4750)
      would be a good fit for <B
CLASS="command"
>su</B
>.</P
><P
>The same logic can be applied to other directories and files in
      the root filesystem using the following steps:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Assign ownership to the root user and root group.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Set the most restrictive permissions possible.</P

>Adjust ownership and permissions on an "as needed"
          basis.</P

>The root disk has come a long way since its humble beginnings as a
    statically-linked shell. It now shares many features with the popular,
    ready-made distributions. For example it has:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Several common utilities like <B
CLASS="command"
>cat</B
>,
        <B
CLASS="command"
>ls</B
> and so on.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Startup scripts that automatically check and mount
        filesystems.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Graceful shutdown capability.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Support for multiple users and virtual terminals.</P
></LI
></UL
><P
>As a final test, we can put the root disk up against the Filesystem
    Hierarchy Standard (FHS) requirements for the root filesystem. (We will
    ignore anything in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr</TT
> hierarchy because of
    space constraints.) Compared to FHS requirement, the only files missing
    are a few commands in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/bin</TT
> directory.
    Specifically, the root disk lacks the following commands:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="command"
>more</B
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B
></P
></LI
><LI
><P
><B
CLASS="command"
>sed</B
></P
></LI
></UL
><P
>In addition to the required commands, it might be nice to include
    the "ed" editor listed as an option by the FHS. It is not as robust as vi
    or emacs, but it works and it should fit onto the tiny root
    filesystem.</P
><P
>So in order to finish up this phase of the project, we need to
    accomplish the following goals:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>Add the <B
CLASS="command"
>more</B
>, <B
CLASS="command"
>ps</B
> and
        <B
CLASS="command"

>There is a <B

      util-linux, but it will not work for this project. The reason is because
      of library dependencies and space constraints. The util-linux supplied
      <B
CLASS="command"
>more</B
> needs either the libncurses or libtermcap to
      work and there just is not enough space on the root disk floppy to fit
      everything in. So, in order to have a <B
CLASS="command"
>more</B
> command we
      will have to get creative.</P
><P
>The <B
CLASS="command"
>more</B
> command is used to display a file page
      by page. It's a little like having a <B
CLASS="command"

      pauses every twenty-five lines. The basic logic is outlined
      below.</P

>Of course there are some details left out like what to do if the
      screen dimensions are not what we anticipated, but overall it is a fair
      representation of what <B
CLASS="command"
>more</B
> does. Given this simple
      program logic, it should not be hard to put together a short shell
      script that emulates the basic functionality of <B
CLASS="command"

      The BASH(1) manpage and Adv-BASH-Scripting-Guide will serve as

      <B

      <TT
CLASS="filename"

>A.1. Analysis</H1
><P
>An operating system by itself is not much fun. What makes an OS
    great is the applications that can be run on top of it. Unfortunately,
    Pocket Linux currently does not have much room for anything other than
    system programs. Still, it would be nice to expand the system just enough
    to host some cool applications. Obviously a full-blown X-Windows GUI is
    out of the question, but running a small console based program should be
    within our reach.</P
><P
>Rather than doing a typical "hello world" program as an example,
    application hosting will be demonstrated using a console based audio
    player called mp3blaster. Building mp3blaster offers more technical
    challenge than "hello world" and the finished product should be a lot more
    fun. However, it should not be construed that a console-based jukebox is
    the only application for Pocket Linux. On the contrary, after completing
    this phase the reader should have the knowledge and tools to build almost
    any console-based program he or she desires.</P
><P
>So what will it take to turn a pocket-sized GNU/Linux system into a
    pocket-sized mp3 player? A few things are listed below.</P

      available from <A
HREF="../../../index.html"

>The Linux Documentation

      like any other piece of new hardware. To add new hardware to a GNU/Linux
      system we will need configure the kernel to recognize it and configure

      program is to mount an additional storage device. There are several
      choices for mount points. So far <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr</TT
>,
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/home</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/opt</TT

      directories and any one of them could be used to mount a floppy, CD-ROM
      or additional compressed ramdisk image. The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr</TT
>
      directory is a logical choice for a place to put an application, but
      what about the choice of media? Mp3blaster and its required libraries
      are too big to fit on a 1.44M floppy and burning a CD-ROM seems like a
      lot of work for one little program. So given these constraints, the best
      choice would be to put the program on a compressed floppy.</P

><P
>Mounting CDs and uncompressed diskettes is easy, but what about
        loading compressed images from floppy into ramdisk? It will have to be
        done manually, because automatic mounting of compressed floppies only
        works for the root diskette. And using <B
CLASS="command"
>mount
        /dev/fd0</B
> will not work because there is no filesystem on the
        diskette, there are only the contents of a gzip file. The actual
        filesystem is contained inside the gzip file. So how can we mount the
        filesystem buried beneath the gzip file? This puzzle can be solved by
        examining at the steps used to create the familiar compressed root

        Most CD burning applications use a filesystem called ISO-9660 and have

      other supporting files available as part of the compressed

      The familiar <B
CLASS="command"

      which libraries mp3blaster requires. Any additional libraries can be
      placed in <TT

>, is
      smart enough to look in both places when loading libraries.</P
><P
>Because mp3blaster uses the curses (or ncurses) screen control
      library there is one additional file we need. The curses library needs
      to know the characteristics of the terminal it is controlling and it
      gets that information from the terminfo database. The terminfo database
      consists of all the files under the
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/share/terminfo</TT
> directory and is very large
      compared to our available disk space. But, since Pocket Linux only
      supports the PC console, we only have one terminal type to worry about
      and therefore need only one file. The piece of the terminfo database we
      need is the file <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/share/terminfo/l/linux</TT
>,
      because we are using a "Linux" terminal. For more information about the

    functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
    everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
    without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit
    for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications
    made by others.</P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
    designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can
    be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it
    is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

>B.2. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H1
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work, in
    any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying
    it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice
    grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use
    that work under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below,
    refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,
    and is addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
    distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
    law.</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any
    work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim,
    or with modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a
    front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
    relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
    Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
    that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the
    Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
    explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
    connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
    commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
    them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary
    Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant
    Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this
    License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then
    it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain
    zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant
    Sections then there are none.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of
    text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A
    Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at
    most 25 words.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a
    machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is
    available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the
    document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
    composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
    available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
    formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable
    for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
    format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or
    discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image
    format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A
    copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the
    title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold,
    legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
    For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
    Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's
    title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</P
><P
>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of
    the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
    parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here
    XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
    "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To
    "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the Document means
    that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according to this
    definition.</P

><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P
><P
>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
    and you may publicly display copies.</P

>B.4. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H1
><P
>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
    Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
    cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably)
    on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
    along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
    computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
    access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
    copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
    year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
    through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.</P

    the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
    Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version
    filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In
    addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P

        the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it
        was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may
        omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
        years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
        version it refers to gives permission.</P

        substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or
        dedications given therein.</P

>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
    these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
    Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.</P

>You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
    example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
    an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</P
><P
>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
    a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
    of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover
    Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements
    made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for
    the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same
    entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
    replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher
    that added the old one.</P

    Warranty Disclaimers.</P

    multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy.
    If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different
    contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end
    of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of

    and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
    distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the copyright resulting
    from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the
    compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the
    Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the
    other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of
    the Document.</P

    copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the
    entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that
    bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of
    covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear

    Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission
    from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or
    all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these
    Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all
    the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
    provided that you also include the original English version of this
    License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In
