     3.22 What exactly is the difference between ftape, and zftape?
     3.23 What is the difference between a rewinding, and non rewinding drive?
     3.24 Can someone tell me how to use mt to rewind my TR-3 drive one record using zftape record, so I can verify it?
     3.25 By non-rewinding, they mean that it doesn't automatically rewind, correct? It doesn't mean that under no circumstances it will rewind, right?  I tried using /dev/zqft0, and it instantly rewinds the tape.

  2.  "Compiling and installing Ftape" related questions !



  2.1.  What Ftape version should I use?


  Always the latest stable version which is _supposed_ to be available
  from ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes and http://www-
  math.math.rwth-aachen.de/~LBFM/claus/ftape/

  At time of this writing the latest stable version is ftape-4.02.

  <answer from Claus Heine>

  2.2.  I'm having problems getting my XYZ drive to run under the 2.0.xx
  kernel with the built-in driver.  How do I fix this?


  The default version of Ftape included in the 2.0.xx kernel sources is
  2.08 or 2.09 and is very out of date.  Please update the Ftape drivers
  to the latest from the Ftape Home Page.

  <answer from Tim Jones>

  2.3.  I'm running Linux/SMP and the system just freezes when trying to
  access the Ftape devices!


  You need to add -D__SMP__ to the KERNEL_OPT variable in the file
  MCONFIG. In newer ftape versions you only need to uncomment a certain
  line in the MCONFIG file.

  <answer from Claus Heine>


  2.4.  Why does depmod complain about "undefined symbols"?


  Ignore the depmod error messages. The problem is that the Ftape
  modules have to be compiled without the version checksum feature (i.e.
  CONFIG_MODVERSIONS) with 2.0.* kernels. This causes no problem, even
  when the modules are used with a kernel that has support for this
  feature; only that depmod wrongly complains about undefined symbols.
  Ignore the complaints of depmod and try to insert the modules despite
  of these complaints:


       modprobe zftape




  If this fails, something is wrong.

  <answer from Claus Heine>


  2.5.  "insmod" says the kernel version is wrong


  The insmod program can check the kernel version against the version
  that Ftape was compiled for in two ways: It can directly compare the
  kernel version number recorded in the Ftape module against the version
  of the running kernel, or, if both the kernel and Ftape is compiled
  with versioned symbols, compare the version of the used kernel
  symbols.

  If you have upgraded your version of GCC to v2.7.0 or later, you must
  recompile the modules utilities with gcc v2.7.x.

  Newer versions of insmod allows you to "force" insertion of a module
  into the kernel, even though the version string is incorrect.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  2.6.  "insmod" says that kernel 1.2.0 and 1.2.0 differ


  Did you remember to apply the ksyms.c patch to the kernel?  If not,
  read the README.linux-1.2 file in the source distribution.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  2.7.  Trying to compile Ftape gives me the error "modversions.h: no
  such file or directory"


  The modversions.h file is created when the kernel is compiled with the
  configuration item CONFIG_MODVERSIONS turned on.  With this option
  enabled, the file will be created during the make dep step.

  One more handy tip is that a make mrproper will remove
  /usr/include/linux/modversions.h.  You will need to reconfig the
  kernel and do a make dep to get the file back.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  2.8.  What is this versioned symbols stuff anyway?


  When you say `yes' to CONFIG_MODVERSIONS during `make config', all the
  symbols exported by the kernel, i.e: the symbols that the loadable
  modules can "see", are augmented to include a checksum across the
  types of the call/return parameters.  This allows insmod to detect
  whether the definition of a variable or function in the kernel has
  changed since the time when Ftape was compiled.

  This ensures a high degree of safety, such that you do not crash the
  kernel because you used an outdated module with your kernel.

  If you enable CONFIG_MODVERSIONS in the kernel, make sure you have

  -DMODVERSIONS -include /usr/include/linux/modversions.h


  uncommented in the MODULE_OPT line in the Ftape Makefile.  Conversely,
  if you do not have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS enabled, make sure you have it
  commented out.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  2.9.  I seem to be getting sftape instead of zftape. When I run "ftmt
  status" command, I get output that the Ftape docs says corresponds to
  sftape ( /dev/qft0: Invalid argument ). Why?



  There are (at least) two possible sources of the problem:

  ·  All Ftape-3.* versions prior to 3.04 install the modules into


       /lib/modules/misc
       instead of
       /lib/modules/uname -r/misc




  As modprobe searches in /lib/modules/misc/ last there might be an old
  ftape.o module floating around in /lib/modules/ uname -r/misc which
  modprobe finds first (uname -r stands for the kernel version).  Remove
  the old ftape.o module.

  ·  Your kernel has support for Ftape compiled in. Reconfigure your
     kernel without support for Ftape (CONFIG_FTAPE) and recompile and
     install it.

  <answer from Claus Heins>


  2.10.  My Ditto DASH/FC-20/Exabyte Accelerator card works under
  Microsoft Windows, but I get a drive not found type of error in
  /var/log/messages when trying to use it under Linux.


  You are probably trying to use the same IRQ and DMA settings as your
  on-board FDC. This does not work in versions of Ftape prior to 3.03b.
  Please update the Ftape Drivers to the latest from the Ftape Home
  Page.

  <answer from Tim Jones>


  2.11.  Ftape DMA transfers gives ECC errors


  Sadly to say there are some SVGA cards and Ethernet cards that do not
  decode their addresses correct.  This typically happens when the Ftape
  buffers are in the range 0x1a0000 to 0x1c0000.  Somehow, the DMA write
  cycles get clobbered and every other byte written gets a bad value
  (0xff).  These problems are reported to happen with both SVGA and
  Ethernet cards.  We know of at least one (bad?) ATI 16bit VGA card
  that caused this.

  The easiest solution is to put the card in an 8bit slot (it is often
  not enough to reconfigure the card to 8bit transfers).  Moving the
  Ftape buffer away from the VGA range is only a partial solution; All
  DMA buffers used in Linux can have this problem!  Let us make this one
  clear: This has nothing to do with the Ftape software.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  2.12.  Help! I'm getting 'dmaalloc() failed' in my syslog file.


  You should only see this is you are trying to insmod the ftape.o
  module.  Try running swapout first.  It is provided with the
  standalone Ftape source.  It doesn't appear in the Ftape source that's
  provided with the kernel.


  Here's an example of how you can set your rc.local file to use it.



       # Install the Floppy Tape Driver
       if [ -f /boot/modules/`uname -r`/misc/ftape.o ]; then
          echo Installing ftape for Linux `uname -r`
          swapout
          insmod /boot/modules/`uname -r`/misc/ftape.o
       fi




  Please note that you won't have this type of problem if you compile
  the Ftape driver into the kernel.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  2.13.  Syslogd works overtime when running Ftape


  The compile-time options NO_TRACE and NO_TRACE_AT_ALL in Ftape control
  the amount of system logging.  Add whichever is appropriate to the
  FTAPE_OPT line in the Makefile and recompile.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  2.14.  How do I change the trace-level?


  There are three ways you can do this (in order of personal
  preference).

  While we're at it, here are the meanings of the various trace levels.


  ·  0 Bugs

  ·  1 + Errors

  ·  2 + Warnings

  ·  3 + Information

  ·  4 + More information

  ·  5 + Program flow

  ·  6 + FDC/DMA info

  ·  7 + Data flow

  ·  8 + Everything else


  1. Using insmod to change trace-level

     If you are using the modules mechanism to load the Ftape driver,
     you can specify the tracing level as an option to the insmod
     command.



          /sbin/insmod ftape.o tracing=<tracing-level>




  2. Using mt to change trace-level

     The Ftape driver has a hack in it that allows the fsr option in mt
     to be used to set the tracing level.  zftape does not have this
     hack.


               mt -f /dev/ftape fsr <tracing-level>




  The use of the fsr command in mt is a hack, and will probably disap­
  pear or change with time.

  3. Recompiling to change trace-level

     The file tracing.c contains a line int tracing = 3;.  Change the 3
     to whatever is appropriate and recompile.

  <From the Ftape-Howto>


  2.15.  I'm having problems with Ftape.  I'm using the latest version
  of Ftape from the Ftape Home Page and believe that I've located a real
  bug. What should I do?


  Check the Ftape Home Page.  for an even newer version. Then check the
  FAQ contained in the that package if your problem is listed there.
  Next, try to check if the manual that comes with the Ftape
  distribution mentions your problem.

  There is no need to read the entire manual, simply check the "Concept
  Index" if it contains a keyword that might be related to your problem,
  then jump to the proper location in the manual.

  If you are still convinced you've found a bug, then post a general
  question describing the problem to the Linux-Tape Mailing List , but
  do not attach your entire Ftape error-log. If we've seen the problem
  before, we'll let you know where the resolution effort stands.  If we
  haven't, the Ftape maintainer will most likely request that you send
  him the entire Ftape error-log (snipped from your system messages
  file).

  <answer from Tim Jones>


  3.  "Using Ftape" related questions !



  3.1.  How fast is Ftape ?


  You can achieve quite respectable backup and restore speeds with
  Ftape: a Colorado DJ-20 and an Adaptec 1542CF controller, has been
  measured at 4.25Mbyte/min sustained data transfer rate (no
  compression) across a 70Mbyte tar archive, while comparing the archive
  on the tape with data on an IDE disk.  The speed of Ftape is mostly
  dependent on the data transfer rate of your FDC: The AHA1542CF has a
  ``post-1991 82077'' FDC, and it will push 1Mbit/sec at the tape drive.
  If you have an FDC which can only deliver 500Kbit/sec data rates, you
  will see half the transfer rate (well, roughly).



  3.2.  When I write to some of my tapes, they seem to spend a lot of
  time "shoe-shining," or repositioning instead of streaming.  Is some­
  thing wrong with my system?


  There has been a few reports of "shoeshining".  This is when the tape
  just seems to run back and forth endlessly.  This has been seen on a
  Jumbo 250 (74407.3051@compuserve.com) and on an Iomega 250 Ditto
  Insider (tom@opus.cais.com). In the latter case it has been narrowed
  own to using an ELF Linux and running off a SCSI hard disk (connected
  to an Adaptec 1542cf).  Please contact me if you have an update to
  this problem.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>

  Probably not. If you are backing up a large number of < 2K files,
  you're just going to have to live with it.  In this event, the
  repositions are caused by file system access overhead. If you are
  backing up a normal system's files, this may be caused by slop or
  media stretching in the tape cartridge. By simply retensioning the
  tape, you should see this go away. Try


       ftmt -f /dev/zqft0 reten




  to retension the tape. If retensioning doesn't solve this, and it's
  only happening on certain tapes, it might be wise to replace the tapes
  in question.

  <answer from Tim Jones>

  If you use afio as your backup tool you can set it to write a very
  large number of buffers in one hit by using the -c flag. Make it large
  enough so that you supply enough data for most of a single end-to-end
  pass over the tape.  For my system, the following streams quite nicely
  - stopping relatively few times per tape pass on an unloaded system:


       find /usr/local -xdev -print | afio -o -v -f -b 10240 -c 800 /dev/qft0




  In my case I'm writing 800 x 10240 bytes per tape write, i.e. about
  8MB.  haven't experimented that much with these settings - so someone
  might like to establish more optimal ones.

  Presumably other backup utilities could be modified to use a similar
  technique.

  <answer by Michael Hamilton>

  GNU tar doesn't use buffering in this way. The commercial backup
  program "bru" is able to multi-buffer using shared memory; this works
  only when writing compressed archive with bru (regardless whether you
  use Ftape's builtin compression)

  Another way to overcome the problem might be to use more dma buffers
  in the Ftape kernel driver like:


       mt -f /dev/qft0 setdrvbuffer $((6*32786))




  $((6*32786)) should be expanded by your shell when using a Bourne com­
  patible one. This has a negative impact on the system's memory pool:
  Ftape's dma buffers cannot be used by any other part of the kernel nor
  by any other application. And kernel memory cannot be swapped out. If
  you decide to use this kind of multi-buffering then you should unload
  the driver as soon as it isn't needed any longer.

  <answer by Claus Heine>


  3.3.  Do I have to reboot to the DOS world to format tapes?


  Not if you are using the latest version of the Ftape drivers from  the
  Ftape Home Page.

  To format a QIC-80, TR-1, TR-3, QICWide 3010 or 3020 tape, get the
  latest version of ftape and the latest version of the ftape-tools
  package (from the same location) and read the documentation of the
  ftformat utility which is included in the ftape-tools package.

  (* Do not try to format Ditto 2GB tapes.  *)

  (* Do not try to format Ditto Max or Max Pro tapes.  *)

  <answers from Tim Jones and Claus Heine>


  3.4.  Is it possibly to format Ditto 2GB tapes with ftape?


  It isn't possible to format Ditto 2GB tapes with Ditto 2GB tape drive,
  and it isn't possible at all to re-format Ditto 2GB tapes in a way
  that they still can be used by a Ditto 2GB tape drive.

  This is a hardware limitation of the Ditto 2GB tape drive. It can't be
  helped at the software level, i.e. it isn't ftape's fault.


  3.5.  Is it possibly to format Ditto Max or Max Pro tapes with ftape?


  No, the Ditto Max can't format tapes.

  This is a hardware limitation of the Ditto Max (Pro) tape drive. It
  can't be helped at the software level, i.e. it isn't ftape's fault.


  3.6.  Ftape detects more bad sectors than DOS on QIC-3020 tapes


  If you look at the difference, you will notice that Ftape always
  detects 2784 sectors more than DOS.

  The number that Ftape reports is correct (of course :-). Each
  correctly formatted QIC-3020 tape has 2784 sectors at fixed positions
  that are marked in the bad sector map. To quote from the specs:
       Tracks 5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25 and 27 within 4 seg­
       ments of either EOT or BOT are prone to increased error
       rates due to hole imprints.  Therefore, these regions shall
       be mapped as bad at format time and entered in the bad sec­
       tor map by indicating that all sectors within the identified
       segments are bad.


  This gives 12 tracks * 2 * 4 segments * 29 sectors == 2784 sectors.

  So Ftape choose to report the real number of sectors that cannot be
  used on the tape, while DOS gives a more optimistic number giving a
  better indication of tape quality.  (Ftape's behavior might change in
  the future to detect correct formatting and display the separate
  numbers. It has rather low priority though).

  QIC-3010 are alike QIC-3020 tapes regarding this.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  3.7.  Is it ok that I'm not hearing the tape move when I do a fsf or a
  bsf with mt?


  Yes.  The driver merely updates an internal counter when those
  commands are issues.  The tape should move to the proper location on
  the next read or write access to the tape drive.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  3.8.  Why does my XYZ backup program complain about "Invalid argument"
  errors?


  zftape requires the data to be written in multiples of a fixed minimal
  block size. This is a very usual behavior for a tape device. There are
  three ways to get rid of those errors:

  ·  set Ftape's block size to the block size used by the backup
     program. The example below works for "afio":


       mt -f /dev/qft0 setblk 5120




  ·  If you don't want to use Ftape's built in compression you can also
     use


       mt -f /dev/qft0 setblk 0




  to switch Ftape to variable block size mode and be able to write the
  data in arbitrary portions to the tape (BUT: the builtin compression
  doesn't work with this setting). When you intend to use "KBackup" then
  this is the only way to make it work together with Ftape (it _may_
  work, don't know if it does)

  ·  tell your backup program about Ftape's default block size of 10k
     (which is also the default of GNU tar). For "afio" you can use the
     following command line switch:


       afio -b 10k ...




  You may want to read the section "Tape blocks" of the manual (use its
  "Concept index" to directly jump to that section)

  When using GNU tar's builtin compression with GNU tar versions prior
  to tar-1.12 one needs to run tar with the --block-compress switch to
  re-block the output to the tape.  Otherwise tar will compress the data
  it reads, and write it in arbitrary portions to the tape.



       Example :

       tar -czvf /dev/qft0 --block-compress /etc




  WARNING: One shouldn't use tar's builtin compression with large
  backups as it makes the entire data stream one huge compressed block.
  If such archives are corrupted right at the beginning it will be very
  difficult to recover.

  <answer by Claus Heine>


  3.9.  I/O errors and FDC - some explanations.


  When you get next messages, this could be interesting for you !


  ·  fdc-io.c (ft_handle_perpend) - Your FDC does not support QIC-3020.

  ·  Cannot write to /dev/qft0: I/O error

  The explanations:

  "FDC" menas "Floppy Disk Controller". The problem is that your floppy
  disk controller must be able to support something that is called
  "perpendicular mode" to be able to read and write QIC-3020/QIC-3010
  cartridges (i.e. TR-3 cartridges). To my knowledge all FDCs that are
  capable of at least 1Mbit/sec data transfer rate also support
  "perpendicular mode" ("perpendicular" refers to the direction of
  magnetization of the ferro-magnetic particles on the tape).

  This means that you need to purchase another FDC. Either look around
  some computer stores and ask for an IO controller cards that is able
  to support 2.88 Mb floppies (which imlies 1Mbit data transfer rate and
  perpendicular mode).

  Or get one of the so called "high speed" controllers that even support
  2Mbit/sec data transfer rate. Those controllers are based on an Intel
  82078 FDC. Iomega sells such a card under the name "Ditto Dash". I
  think Exabyte sells their 2Mbit controllers separately, too, whereas
  Seagate ships its TR-3 drives (i.e. the TST-3200) together with such a
  controller.


  <answer from Claus Heine>


  3.10.  Why do I get "/dev/qft0: No such device" errors?


  I assume that the following is the problem: The Ftape module is loaded
  OK into the kernel:


       /usr/src/ftape-3.03b-970603# lsmod
        Module         Pages    Used by
        ftape             22            0




  but then this happens:


       $ ftmt -f /dev/qft0 status
       ftmt: /dev/qft0: No such device




  Solution You need to load the zftape.o module as well. With Ftape-3.*
  the ftape.o module doesn't implement the VFS interface. This is done
  by zftape.o.

  3.11.  I get "device busy" when I make multiple backups on a tape
  using some script.


  The "device busy" messages can only occur while the Ftape devices are
  still held open by some program. As soon as the close() system call
  has completed the busy flag is cleared. May be "bru" or some other
  program has still forked off a child that dies delayed?

  Yes, this will reproduce the problem, it seems:


       tar -cvvzf /dev/nqft0 --block-compress ; mt rewind




  You can skip the "--block-compress" if using the most recent version
  of GNU tar.

  However, this is not a bug of Ftape. It seems that the parent tar
  process exits before its child has closed the tape device. I know,
  however, from hacking the tar code ages ago, that tar properly waits
  for its parent to die.

  However, the busy message simply means that the "busy" variable is
  still held at 1 (zftape/zftape-init.c). And this simply means that
  there still is a process hanging around that holds the tape device
  open.

  I think I have it (only for the case of tar 'cause I have the source
  code.

  If on uses tar with compression, then it forks a child which will
  become the compressor bei execing  "gzip" or whatever. Before the call
  to execlp() the child will fork off a grand child of its parent tar.
  That grandchild will do the actual tape I/O.


       tar - fork() - write to child tar
               |
             child tar - fork() - gzip (will pipe to grand child tar)
                           |
                         grand child tar - open archive.




  Now, parent tar only waits for its child to die. gzip surely doesn't
  wait for the grand child as the gzip is a result of an execlp().

  What I don't know is whether the grand child should be implicitly
  waited for by the parent tar, or if the wait() function also waits for
  grand childs.

  But this seems to be the problem: the parent tar already has exited
  while its grandchild still is busy closing the archive. One hardly
  will notice this problem if the close() happens fast (i.e. regular
  files, block devices, also other tape devices?), but it isn't a bug in
  Ftape, but either in the backup programs or in the kernel or maybe
  libc exit code.

  Don't know if the considerations above also apply to bru. If there is
  no grandchild and the parent process properly waits for its childs
  then there shouldn't be a problem.

  3.12.  How do I "..." with tar?


  These are really tar questions: Please read the man page and the info
  page.  If you have not got it either, try


       tar  --help 2>&1 | less




  If your version of tar is v1.11.1 or earlier, consider upgrading to
  v1.11.8 - This version can call GNU zip directly (i.e.: it supports
  the -z option) and has an elaborate help included.  Also, it compiles
  right out of the box on Linux.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  3.13.  What block-size should I use with tar ?


  When using compression, and in all general, it can be a benefit to
  specify to tar, that it should block the output into chunks.  Since
  Ftape cuts things into 29Kbyte blocks, saying `-b58' should be
  optimum.

  "Why 29Kbyte?", I hear you cry.  Well, the QIC-80 standard specifies
  that all data should be protected by an Error Correcting Code (ECC)
  code.  The code specified in the QIC-80 standard is known as a Reed-
  Solomon (R-S) code.  The R-S code takes 29 data bytes and generates 3
  parity bytes.  To increase the performance of the ECC code, the parity
  bytes are generated across 29 1Kbyte sectors.  Thus, Ftape takes
  29Kbytes of data, adds 3Kbytes of ECC parity, and writes 32Kbytes to
  the tape at a time.  For this reason, Ftape will always read and write
  32K byte blocks to be able to detect (and correct) data errors.

  If you are curious, and wish to know more, look in the ecc.c and ecc.h
  files, for an explanation of the code and a reference to a textbook on
  Reed-Solomon codes.

  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  3.14.  Where can I find the tar/mt/cpio/dd binaries - sources - man­
  pages?


  All of these tools have been developed by the GNU project, and the
  source (and man page) can be fetched from just-about any ftp site in
  the world (including ftp.funet.fi, tsx-11.mit.edu, and
  sunsite.unc.edu).  In any case they can be fetched from the official
  GNU home site: prep.ai.mit.edu [18.71.0.38]:/pub/gnu.  The latest
  versions (as of September 12 1996) are:



       cpio:   2.4.2 (cpio-2.4.2.tar.gz)
       dd:     3.13 (fileutils-3.13.tar.gz)
       mt:     2.4.2 (cpio-2.4.2.tar.gz)
       tar:    1.11.8 (tar-1.11.8.tar.gz)
       gzip:   1.2.4 (gzip-1.2.4.tar.gz)




  They all compile out of the box on Linux v1.0.4 / libc v4.5.19 / gcc
  v2.5.8.

  3.15.  If I use tapers compression, is it a bad idea to use the com­
  pression with zftape, or would it be better to not use tapers compres­
  sion, and let zftape do it?


  It is not bad as such to compress data twice (which would be the case
  when using tapers compression together with zftape's compression) but
  it doesn't make any sense. You won't gain much further compression,
  but only waste CPU cycles.

  Tapers compression should be quite safe, as taper compresses single
  files; in contrast to tar -czf ... which makes the entire data stream
  a large compressed block of data, which is really a bad thing with
  serious backups as a single bad byte at the beginning of the archive
  can make the entire archive unusable, well, it will be at least quite
  difficult to recover.

  <Answer from Claus Heine>





  3.16.  How does zftape compression compare to say gzip -9?


  gzip -9 is better (i.e. one gains higher compression). zftape's
  compression is comparable with the Un*x compress program, but should
  be faster, and is faster than gzip.

  <Answer from Claus Heine>


  3.17.  I don't trust compression, but hear that the sftape interface
  is going away. What should I do?


  Use the zftape interface, but don't load the zft-compressor module.
  The device then becomes /dev/qft0.

  <answer from Tim Jones>


  3.18.  Ftape says "This tape has no 'Linux raw format"


  You get this complaint if you haven't erased your freshly formatted
  tape.  This is because Ftape expect a "magic header" on the tape, to
  be able that it is allowed to interpret the header segment in its own
  way (eg: file marks).  To remove the problem, say

  mt -f /dev/nftape erase



  <from the Ftape-Howto>


  3.19.  Can I exchange tapes with someone using DOS?


  No.  The DOS software conforms to the QIC-80 specs about the layout of
  the DOS filesystem, and it should(?)  be a small problem to write a
  program that can read/write the DOS format.  In fact, I'd bet that
  creating a nice user interface would be a bigger problem.

  <From the Ftape-Howto>


  3.20.  How does `mt eom' work when you've started overwriting a tape
  in the middle?


  (EOM is "End Of recorded Media", the position right after all data
  already recorded to the tape)

  One cannot use tape "files" like files on an ordinary file system.

  In principle, a tape doesn't allow anything but appending new data at
  EOM.  However, if one positiones just in the middle of the already
  recorded data AND starts writing, then the driver first deletes all
  following files (thus moving the EOM to the actual position) and then
  starts writing.

  Thus, the new EOM after finishing the write process, is then after the
  newly recorded data.

  One of the consequences of the above is, of course, that writing to
  the tape in the middle of the already recorded area, is destructive in
  the sense, that it not only overwrites the "file" the tape is
  positioned at, but also deletes all following files.

  <from the Ftape-Howto> <Answer from Claus Heine>


  3.21.  When I made backups before using taper, under the 2.0.29 ftape
  my drive didn't support fsf, under the new zftape it does, why would
  this be, and what exactly is fsf ?


  It probably didn't work before because you didn't use a


       mt -f /dev/rft0 erase




  before writing data to the cartridge. THIS ISN'T necessary any more.

  But, hey, what does mt fsf? Tape drives don't store files in the sense
  that you can use

  cp somefile /dev/my_what_ever_tape


  or be able to mount the tape drive like you could mount a harddisk.
  You can't do nothing with a tape drive but write data to it in a
  sequential manner.

  As this is quite inconvenient, somebody invented something which is
  known under the name file mark or eof mark (eof == End Of File). Those
  marks don't separate files that have been backed up to the tape
  device, but only separate blocks of data (whatever data that might
  be).

  Normally, the kernel tape device drivers take care of writing file
  marks when the tape device is closed, i.e.


       tar -cf /dev/nqft0 /bin
       tar -cf /dev/nqft0 /etc
       mt -f /dev/nqft0 rewind




  would result in a backup of all files under /bin and /etc. When the
  first tar finishes, the kernel driver will take care of writing a file
  mark to the tape at the the current tape position, and when the second
  tar process has finished, another file mark is written to the tape
  cartridge at that position.

  Now, the sense of those file marks is, that it is possible to skip
  between different archives on the tape more quickly than would be
  possible with reading the data back.

  The commands to do that are:

     mt fsf
        fast skip to the next file mark towards EOT (End Of Tape)

     mt bsf
        fast skip to the next file marks towards BOT (Begin Of Tape)

  Thus, to extract the second archive in the example above, one doesn't
  need to read the first archive back, but can proceed as follows:


       mt -f /dev/nqft0 rewind
       mt -f /dev/nqft0 fsf
       tar -xvf /dev/nqft0




  <Answer from Claus Heine>


  3.22.  What exactly is the difference between ftape, and zftape?


  When Ftape was young there were two versions of the floppy tape
  driver, one of them was called zftape because of its built-in user-
  transparent on-the-fly compression. Whether such a thing is a feature
  or a bug ('cause this needn't be done in kernel space) is another
  question. However, the ioctl interface and file mark handling provided
  by zftape was much better and had less bugs. And zftape allows to use
  floppy tape cartridges with different OS. Well, you can't exchange
  data, but zftape won't overwrite volumes created by your Windoze
  program, and vice versa.

  Nowadays, Ftape is name of the entire floppy tape driver package AND
  ftape.o is the file-name of the kernel module that implements the low-
  level hardware support. zftape has ceased to exist as a separate
  package, but the new Ftape versions (since ftape-3.00) contain a
  zftape.o module that needs to be loaded on top of ftape.o (i.e. you
  need to load BOTH modules to be able to access your floppy tape drive)
  and implements the file system interface and the advanced (?) features
  of the previous verions zftape.

  <Answer from Claus Heine>


  3.23.  What is the difference between a rewinding, and non rewinding
  drive?


  Well, the rewinding tape devices rewind the tape to BOT (Begin Of
  Tape) when the device is closed, i.e.


       tar -cvf /dev/qft0 /bin




  will rewind the tape cartridge when the tar job has finished. In con­
  trast,


       tar -cvf /dev/nqft0 /bin




  will NOT rewind the tape cartridge and leave the tape R/W head at its
  current position.

  Rewinding devices should be used when performing a single backup, non-
  rewinding devices can be useful when doing multiple backups as one
  doesn't need to space to EOM (End Of recorded Media) before appending
  another archive.

  Non-rewinding devices MUST be used when sending any of the tape motion
  command to the tape drive, such as


       mt -f /dev/nqft0 fsf




  , because when the mt process finishes then the tape device is closed
  which would result in rewinding the cartridge with the rewinding
  devices.

  <Answer from Claus Heine>


  3.24.  Can someone tell me how to use mt to rewind my TR-3 drive one
  record using zftape record, so I can verify it?


  Well, it depends. If the tape is still positioned inside the volume
  just written, "mt bsf 1" (or equivalently "mt bsf") will backspace
  just to the beginning of that volume (this is how "tar --verify"
  works). If the tape is already positioned AFTER the filemark that
  marks the end of the last written volume, then you need to issue "mt
  bsf 2"

  The logic behind this is as follows: "MTBSF count" backspaces over
  count file marks, stops, and then positions on the EOT side of the
  last skipped file mark. This means, an "mt bsf 2" will position right
  at the beginning of the previous volume.

  <answer form Claus Heine>


  3.25.  By non-rewinding, they mean that it doesn't automatically
  rewind, correct? It doesn't mean that under no circumstances it will
  rewind, right?  I tried using /dev/zqft0, and it instantly rewinds the
  tape.


  You are right: auto-rewind means, the tape is rewound when the tape
  device is closed, non-rewinding  means, the tape isn't automatically
  rewound when the tape device is closed (but you can, of course, use
  the tape motion commands BSF/FSF etc. to position the tape head at
  every position you like).

  <answer form Claus Heine>


  3.26.  What is the difference between what mt considers a record and
  what it considers a file?


  A record is the minimal amount of bytes that will be accepted by the
  tape in one read/write operation (except in "variable block size mode"
  where it just should be the amount of data actually written in a
  single write operation??).

  For zftape every read and write access has to be a multiple of a fixed
  block size (fixed, but tunable with MTSETBLK). This block size is a
  "tape record" (as mentioned in the GNU mt man page and defaults to
  10kb for zftape.
  A "file" (in the sense of the mt man page) is a, well, misleading
  terminus. What is meant is an area of the tape between two file marks.
  This is not a file like a file on the file system, in the sense that
  it could have a name, file access modes, could be moved or copied with
  cp, mv, rm etc.

  Instead, It simply is the area of the tape that was recorded in one
  backup session, its end is marked by a tape file mark, and its
  beginning is delimited by either BOT or the file mark of the previous
  tape "file". That tape "files" are the things that can be skipped with
  the MTBSF/FSF commands.

  <answer form Claus Heine>


  3.27.  Reusing tapes with zftape without reformatting the tape.


  We try to answer the followong questions :

  ·  Is there a good way to erase, as in remove the data or at least the
     volumes from a tape, without reformating?

  ·  Can you overwrite the last volume on a tape with making a mess out
     of it?

  ·  Can you overwrite the last several volumes without making a mess?

  ·  Can you delete the last volume?

  If you want to "erase" an entire cartridge, then simply do:



       mt -f /dev/qft0 erase




  This will erase the volume table (i.e. the "file marks").

  Pre-ftape-3.x releases of zftape and ftape used to allow overwriting
  of already existing volumes on a cartridge. I have removed this
  feature as it was reported that it already has caused data-loss with
  some backup programs.

  If you indeed need to remove some volumes on the tape then you should
  use the



       vtblc




  program that comes with the ftape-tools package which can be down-
  loaded from the same locations as the ftape kernel driver package.
  Please refer to the documentation which is contained in the ftape-
  tools package for more information.

  If you simply want to reuse old tapes, then it suffices to do




  mt rewind




  If the tape is at BOT (Begin Of Tape) then every write access to the
  tape will silently erase all file marks and overwrite the data already
  existing on the tape.

  3.28.  This script implements a simple contents listing for the zftape
  package using the "MTIOCVOLINFO" ioctl.


  Here is as little perl/bash script that lists the contents of a
  cartridge using the zftape specific "volinfo" ioctl. Hope this shows
  how to handle this kind of stuff.

  What it basically does is the following:


  1. Rewind the cartridge

  2. Issue the volinfo command:


          claus@thales:~$ mt volinfo
          file number          = 1
          block size           = 10240
          physical space used  =  522.0 kilobytes
          real size of volume  =  520.0 kilobytes




  Parse the ouput and place the values in appropriate variables

  3. Skip to the next volume with "mt fsf"

  4. Exit if this gives an error (EOD), otherwise "goto 2)"

  4.  "Tape and Drivers" related questions !



  4.1.  What are good makers of Travan tapes?


  I was the UNIX Product Manager at Archive Corp (Prior to the
  Conner/Seagate mess) and we performed extensive tests of tape media
  for compatibility certification, including retentivity, flaking and
  length consistancy.  Based on the results of the tests, we selected
  the best of these certified manufacturers' products to private label
  as our own media.  Here is the order in which we selected vendors up
  through 1995 (when I lost contact with the ATI group):


     QIC

        1. 3M (now known as Imation)

        2. QMaxell/Sony (tie)

        3. (BTW - Iomega uses Sony private-labelled media)

     4MM

        1. Fuji

        2. Maxell/Sony (tie - is this a trend?)

     8MM

        1. Fuji/Exabyte - which we believed to be OEM'd Fuji (tie - so
           much for trend!)

        2. Sony

        3. Maxell

     DLT

        1. Maxell

        2. Sony


  Otherwise, we had entries in our search from other vendors which were
  generally a private-labelled version of one of the major labels above.
  The exceptions were Verbatim and DIC.  Both of these manufacturer's
  media had fall-out rates and length discrepancies that were so high
  that we would not certify them and even warned customers about them
  indicating that we could not offer any sort of guarantee that they
  would get a good backup using the media from these manufacturers.

  In addition, since coming to EST, I've found that Verbatim media is
  still not worth the money saved in purchasing it.  We have 11 of their
  TR-Extra and QIC-Extra (QICXL) tapes that were useless after fewer
  than 20 passes each.

  While this is my personal opinion, it is based on over 9 years of
  experience with this very question, I strongly recommend Imation/3M
  media for QIC/Travan user, Fuji media 4MM users, Exabyte/Fuji for 8MM
  and DEC labelled media for DLT users.

  4.2.  Where can I obtain the QIC standards?


  If you wish to help developing Ftape, or add some utility (e.g. a tape
  formatting program), you will need that appropriate QIC standards.
  The standard(s) to get is: QIC-80, -117, -3010, and 3020.  QIC-117
  describes how commands are sent to the tape drive (including timing
  etc), so you would probably never need it.  QIC-80/3010/3020 describes
  higher level part, such as tape layout, ECC code, standard filesystem.
  You can get the QIC standards from the following address:



       Quarter Inch Cartridge Drive Standards, Inc.
       311 East Carrillo Street
       Santa Barbara, California 93101
       Phone: (805) 963-3853
       Fax:   (805) 962-1541




  Note: They are registered as `Freeman Associates, Inc' in the phone
  book.

  4.3.  Is the Iomega Ditto 2GB drive supported?


  Yes, if you are using version ftape-3.x or later of the Ftape drivers
  from the Ftape Home Page or from
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes.

  <answer from Tim Jones>

  As the Ditto 2GB is a Tr-3 tape (though it can only store 1GB instead
  of the 1.6GB you get with a regular Tr-3 drive) you need an FDC (FDC
  means: Floppy Disk Controller) that is capable of at 1Mbit/sec
  transfer rate. You don't need to worry about this if you have an
  accellerator card (i.e. the Ditto Dash controller). Otherwise try to
  purchase an FDC that claims to be capable of driving 2.88Mb floppies
  because this implies that the FDC is capable of 1Mbit transfer rate.

  Ftape prints the maximum data rate of the FDC to the kernel log files
  like this:

  ftape-ctl.c (ftape_init_drive) - Highest FDC supported data rate: 500 Kbps.

  4.4.  Is the Iomega Ditto Max drive supported?


  Yes, if you are using version ftape-4.02 or later of the Ftape drivers
  from the Ftape Home Page or from
  ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/kernel/tapes.

  <answer from Claus Heine>


  4.5.  Is the Iomega Ditto Max Pro drive supported?


  Yes. But if you want to use the 5GB (10GB with compression) cartridges
  you don't need it. With ftape there doesn't seem to be any difference
  between the Ditto Max and the Ditto Max Pro.
