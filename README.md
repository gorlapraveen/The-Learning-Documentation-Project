*This documentation is about the new learning(s) and issue(s) resolvings on different aspects of academic, professional and personal thoughts.* 

It includes(or/with links): *Personal Public thoughts, Artciles, Research topics(& resources), Programming(issues and code),  Advanced Linux commands, Networking* 
*commands, bash script command utilization, Linux packages(& scripts), Machine learning, text documentation, images, tutorial(links) and gitlab links(Personal Pubic repository links).*

Note : *This documentation is mainly intend to reduce time consumption for solving some issues which are already solved/used earlier, This is from my past experience of wasting my time for searching for issues solving* -- by @gorlapraveen

GNUnet is typically run as an overlay network on top of the the existing Internet infrastructure forming the basis of a hybrid peer-to-peer mesh and relay backbone for applications to run on. It could just as well be run independently of the Internet, over dedicated radio and cable. |

“Your effort should not go in vain”

We do share our knowledge with our fellow beings but how far we are successful in delivering our efforts to make others understand well!. In fact, it is not only about delivering but also about how far it can reach from one to one with collective sharing!

So, we do also represent this topic as a cognitive mapping diagram for better understanding it.  Every piece of effort made by you ( for the community) must be reused, your efforts should not go in vain. You should need not to be a direct promoter of your knowledge, it should be a flow from one to other. In fact, it should be the propagation of multiplicative addition of the previous result which eventually reduces the effort for the repetitive tasks.</p>
